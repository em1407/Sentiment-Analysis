"177958","Fabio_Cucina_Italiana",5,"review_732278415","Excellent Meal","We recently dined at Fabrio on a Tuesday evening around 8:30 pm. We had just arrived in NYC and the restaurant was recommended by our hotel. This turned out to be an excellent choice. We were greeted and promptly seated. The wine and bread were excellent. They had a few risotto dishes but my wife wanted to know if they could make a risotto like she had in Florence which had bolognese sauce in it. The Executive Chef Chicco Asante said to give them a few minutes. The staff produced an excellent dish which replicated the risotto from Florence. My wife loved the dish. I had the ORECHIETTE ALLA BARESE (ear shaped pasta, spicy italian sausage, broccili rabe and oasted garlic and olive oil) which was fantastic. The service was excellent. This was a delicious meal and we really appreciated the chef accommadating our request. Well worth a visit.",2019-12-12,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_118714"
"71125","New_York_Luncheonette",3,"review_334713875","Solid choice for breakfast -- if staying nearby","I used to rave about this place. We stumbled upon it years ago and were smitten. An authentic, no-fuss diner with stained menus, decent prices and quick service. We loved it. But as the years have gone by, the menus have gotten glossier, the prices have gotten higher, and it just seems like any other NYC diner. The food is fine, the service is still fast. But it's no longer worth the 8-10 block walk for us to dine here. There are too many other similar restaurants. However, if you are staying nearby, it's worth a visit -- the prices, though higher, are still a lot cheaper than a hotel breakfast!",2015-12-23,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_54555"

"86119","Cuba",5,"review_476859146","Great Neighborhood Cuban Cafe!","This cafe is a gem in the middle of the Village. Very small room and bar when you walk in and we were led into another small room for our dinner. Not sure if there are additional rooms or not. My husband, daughters and I went on a Saturday evening and there was live music and a man rolling complimentary cigars in the corner. Our server, Tony, was excellent and gave us great recommendations. For our appetizers, we shared empanadas and the crabmeat salad special. The filling on all the empanadas (chicken, beef and cheese) was plentiful and tasty. The outside was nice and flaky. The crabmeat salad was pretty big and also extremely tasty. Lots of chunks of real crab in it. For dinner, I had the ceviche mixto and was also packed with lots of seafood. Our other dishes were lechon and shredded beef. Huge portions! We also ordered black beans, yucca and sweet plantains. Lots of leftovers to take home! The mojitos were awesome as was the dark and stormy and mango martini. For dessert we shared a chocolate molten cake that was warm and had bittersweet chocolate. Our tres leches cake was good as well. This food IS definitely the real deal Cuban. Would definitely go back and would like to try for brunch too.",2017-04-18,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_32797"

Prices seemed slightly higher, but, as it turned out, portions were quite generous. My partner and I had lunch for the next day.  Really nice wine pour.

Without thinking that I was not on a business trip, we hoofed it across the street to the Pershing Square Cafe. With no reservation and a family of five with three kids, they were gracious and welcoming and found us a wonderful location to enjoy a luncheon.

The decor has this New England rustic feel with hard wood floors. The restaurant is two levels with full bars on both levels. We sat at a table. The place was packed the entire time we were there and we were there for three hours! The Tuna tartare was an amazing appetizer but the lobster curry with the rice might have been the best meal I have eaten in months. It was a flavor explosion and I was skeptical about ordering it. We then had the pumpkin s'mores for dessert. Everything was flavorful and well made. I highly recommend this place. But, beware, as in everything with NyC the meal was expensive!",2015-01-11,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_46036"

"354513","Blue_Fin",4,"review_374372258","Lunch value ","This was an impromptu lunch stop after striking out at the TKTS booth across the way. We were hungry, disappointed and not too eager to try to brave the Times Square crowds so soon.  A quick search on the gluten-free app showed that this could be an option. We walked across the way to look at the menu, and decided to give it a shot. I mean heck, I love me some seafood, and thankfully, my girls do, too.  Walking in to the foyer, you see a hostess stand, a bar along the back wall, and a large flight of stairs to the left. It was only after we were seated that we realized that the top part of the building was a different restaurant altogether. We weren't given an option at the stand as to which one we wanted to dine in. Maybe because we didn't have reservations? Or maybe we looked too causal, too much like tourists?  Anyway, we were at a small table opposite the door, which was unfortunate in that we got a gust of cold air every time they opened.  Our waiter was friendly enough, but he seemed a bit distracted. They were all running between the bar on our level and the restaurant upstairs, so I'm sure he was just busy.  He did take the time to hear our allergy alert, and to answer our questions. We decided to share the seafood platter (the ""balcony"" version), as well as a spicy tuna roll and a Dynamite roll.  The odd thing is that they brought out pastries to start with. There was a scone, a biscuit and a slice of some kind of carrot cake. Didn't really go with the seafood theme, but of course the two of us who could consume flour ate them.  We were afraid we'd still be hungry after our meal, but it turned out we ordered just enough food; we were satiated without being stuffed.  My favorite thing on the seafood platter was the ceviche. Shame it came in such a small cup! Wait, let me back up.  The platter came with oysters, mussels, squid rings (not fried calamari), crab legs, ceviche and clams. While everything was fresh and tasty, my favorite - as I mentioned - was the ceviche. It was just perfectly prepared, not too citrusy, not too bogged down by other ingredients.  The spicy tuna roll was also very good (my husband would have approved), but the Dynamite roll really wasn't. It was just kind of bland, which was surprising, given all the spice notes rolled up in it.  Overall, it was a good lunch meal to tide us over, and allowed us to feed the seafood urge. Our waiter was friendly enough, but he probably could've used a hand that day. ",2016-05-18,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_68841"

We were seated promptly in an almost empty restaurant. Waiter came around asking what we'd like to drink 10 minutes later. Another 10-12 minutes passed before he came back to take our order. That's ridiculous, esp. in a mostly empty restaurant. Food came about 20 minutes later (was the cook out to lunch?). I ordered the classic hamburger with LOTS of onions. I got a normal portion of onions, that's considering I didn't want the cheese or the mayo that comes with it. The burger was good, NOT great. The portion of french fries was miniscule, with many very small and overfried because they were so small. They were also very salty- not an issue for me but it was for my 3 friends.

My first choice was ruben, but being rooted in their kosher principles, this was not offered. Unlike other delis with globs of fatty meat and bread soaked in the oils, the pastrami was relatively lean, a moderate mouthful. Soup stock was added to the matzo ball soup at the table to keep the matzo from being saturated in the soup, preserving the fresh matzo taste. Only negative issue was the $15 minimum per person,particularly when 2nd person is not an adult with an appetite.

That's all the good stuff done, now for the rest of the review: My number one gripe I'll start with - the cheque arrived WITH the dessert, we weren't even asked if we wanted anything else. I understand tables need to be turned as we were at 18:30 seating and we weren't a high spending table but maybe try making it a bit less obvious. Back to the start - hosts greeted us with grumpy faces, definitely going for the ""let's make this place feel exclusive by treating everyone like they're worthless"" vibe. Shame as I love American hospitality normally. Our starters arrived within 5 minutes of us ordering and were quickly cleared away to bring the rest, and then our whole bottle of wine was emptied into our glasses. Didn't mean we drank it any faster much to the waitresses disgust but couldn't believe how obvious they are at trying to get you to order more.

The food here was outstanding. My wife and I split the chicken and waffles and huevos chorizo, and it was hard to decide which one we each liked best. The C&W came with sides of spiced syrup and a honey mustard sauce, each of which worked very well with the dish. The chicken was super tasty and the flavor combinations were amazing. The eggs and chorizo came with a side of yummy breakfast potatoes, and the eggs had diced chunks of spicy and flavorful chorizo throughout.

I believe The Clocktower restaurant is a separate business, but hotel and restaurant worked as a team to make our stay as comfortable as possible following an unfortunate accident. The restaurant comprises of several atmospheric rooms filled with iconic photographs of the famous. We ate breakfast in the restaurant each day and particularly enjoyed the fruit, granola and yoghurt plus the Eggs Benedict. For Europeans, beware the large portions – each choice is designed to be a complete meal whereas we are more accustomed to having several lighter courses of fruit, juice then cooked breakfast. Our only criticism was the arctic a/c that appeared to reinstate itself as soon as it was turned off. On the evening following my accident, the restaurant manager, James, found us waiting for a table suitable to my invalided state. He and his staff acted with enormous generosity and kindness from that moment, alerting the hotel to my predicament. That evening, we ate from the normal restaurant menu and, though I was unable to enjoy anything due to pain, my husband loved his choices from the a la carte menu. We had booked the special dinner for Thanksgiving and, with pain more under control, we decided to make the most of the one part of our holiday that could not be spoiled. The courses were thoughtfully created and very well balanced showing off the skills of the chef, Jason Atherton, in creating a traditional Thanksgiving dinner with a delicious modern twist. The restaurant touched and surprised us with their next gesture which I will not detail here – but they know and for which we truly thank them.

It also limited the ability of each of us to order separate items. I am not sure what the rational behind the huge portions is, but it did not make for a nice meal because we ended up eating a lot of a couple of items. Also suprised to hear that you had to order pasta in addition to Tony's ""special"" dishes to make it a meat and pasta meal - so more ordering and more food.

"457257","Maya",5,"review_506886789","Real Mexican Food","I've been to Maya a handful of times and it is officially one of those ""In the back pocket"" restaurants. What I mean by that is this is a place that when you know you need a place to be a fail safe, an emergency savior, a great time, an always reliable, a bail a friend out because they need a great place to go, a last meal before you leave the country, etc etc, Maya should always be kept in your back pocket.  It starts from the top down and Corrina (The manager) delivers the best service I've ever experienced in a restaurant. It's rare when you're able to compliment the hostess, servers, and manager all at once every time you visit a restaurant but that's exactly what you get here. Because of the service and what Corrina and her staff deliver this will be a restaurant I always visit. Moving on from that, usually there are two sides of the coin with a restaurant. The service and the food. Those who frequent restaurants will pay for great food even if there is average service or pay for great service even if the food is average. Maya doesn't have to worry about this at all because they offer both great service and great food. Being a Mexican restaurant, there's usually two thoughts. Are you going to get tacos, burritos, and chips and salsa, or are you going to get chile rellenos, mole, and mexican street corn. Maya provides the latter as an authentic Mexican restaurant and not a Tex Mex place. There are a number of different guacamole types to try and I recommend all of them, especially the tuna. I'll be displaying a bunch of pictures to see how good the food looks and they are accurate visual descriptions of how they taste. I've had such a variety of dishes that the best thing for me to do for those reading this is to let you know what I don't recommend getting solely because everything else was just fantastic. I wasn't a fan of the Mahi Mahi. Other than that, please try everything else because you won't be disappointed.  For those of you who drink and like spice in your drinks, please have one of the Mercado and Pepino Margarita's and if you want to know which one out of the two have both. Those happen to be may favorite but it isn't a stretch to say all of the drinks (Except this drink designed like Key Lime Pie that Corrina said would be taken off the menu) are phenomenal. And don't you dare skip dessert. The Mexican donuts must be had but there's also a chocolate tres leches that takes the traditional tres leches up about 2 notches. All and all I rate this restaurant a 9.6 out of 10. The only reason it isn't a 10 is because there's a restaurant in the Maldives that is underwater that I have to reserve the 10 for :-) Thank you Maya!!!",2017-07-29,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_5788"

Prune is a charmingly small restaurant with a Paris vibe, though doesn't try too hard at it. Given its location, you can't escape New York city. But I noticed there were people from all ages and demographics there, affirming its broad appeal. We went for lunch. The menu isn't too large, but each dish appears wholly unique. Our girls group ordered salads and shared french fries and desserts. The shaved celery salad with warm blue cheese covered toast was exceptional, with a lively onion accent to the celery. The classic caesar salad was outstanding, with a hint of anchovy in the dressing only, and huge buttery croutons topping it off. The ""sous chef"" salad was a delicious mix of greens and diced salami, cheese, etc.. very satisfying. The requisite side of french fries.. perfect, with just the right amount of sea salt. As for dessert - ooh la la. We shared chocolate churros.. delicious, light churros with a decadent chocolate sauce for dipping.. and the most magnificent ice cream ever! Mascarpone ice cream with salted caramel and croutons. It was a creamy, smooth texture with the ideal blend of salt and sweet, given the caramel and croutons. By far the favorite dish of the day for this group of girls. Inspiring enough to return just for that. But we'll happily return and order lunch again before indulging in dessert.

"78527","Red_Farm",5,"review_393758754","Inventive and delicious!","This West Village location is conisderably smaller than the one on the Upper West Side -- according to their website it has 42 seats, and they point out that they are mostly at two big communal tables. There are, however, a few booths along the perimeter. There is one restroom. They do not take reservations, except for larger parties with prix fixe menus at certain times. So it takes some deliberate intent to eat here -- we have seen fairly-sized crowds gathered outside waiting for a table. We made a point of getting here when they first opened at 5 p.m. on a Friday, and were actually the very first customers to be seated, snagging a nice booth. Why go through all of the effort? You get super creative Asian-fusion food with happy service and really spectacular beverages in a casual farmhouse-like setting. Oh,and this location offers the huge advantage of being able to order an amazing Peking duck from the restaurant downstairs, too! Whenever we bring ""new"" people here or recommend this place we tell them they must get the Pac-Man dumplings (little seafood dumplings with eyes, in a row, chased by a fried sweet potato ""mouth"" sitting in guacamole) and the Katz's pastrami egg rolls .... and the Peking duck, which is pretty much the traditional dish prepared perfectly with the addition of a duck/miso soup shooter and in addition to the usual hoisin sauce they also give you a peanut sauce and a cranberry one. Everyone also loved the bacon and egg fried rice and the yuzu-wasabi shrimp. Somehow RedFarm always has super wonderful beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. I am partial to the Shiso Wonderful (why yes I am!) which is made with Brooklyn Gin, agave, lemon, cucumber, and shiso leaves. It's one of this cocktails that tastes so nice you forget there is a decent amount of alcohol in it, so beware! Non-alcoholic cocktails include a Thai basil lemonade and a blackberry ginger lime soda. Both are usually hits at our table. Regardless of whether you sit at a booth or at a section of one of the communal tables, space is at a premium. This makes it extra-important that the staff are on top of things like clearing plates and glasses and sequencing delivery of family-style dishes if you decide to eat that way (which I would say you ought to). The servers are on it. I think we only had to ask once for a water refill over the course of a lot of dishes coming and going. There is not a lot of room between tables, either, and the servers move quickly and seemingly effortlessly although I am certain this takes a lot of effort. The staff were all nothing but friendly and enthusiastic. So if you are up for a potential wait and some tightly packed but not uncomfortable space, you will find a fun and delicious menu that NYC visitors and locals alike would enjoy.",2016-07-17,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_2556"

We were surprised when we got there at noon to find that the restaurant was mostly empty. They had some amazing deals there for brunch, especially if you like to drink a lot at brunch, which we weren't intending on! I did have a glass of sangria for $6, however, couldn't resist. I think the beers were $4, and there seemed to be some deal wherein for $16 (or something like that) you could get a brunch entree and unlimited margaritas or sangria. What a deal! There was also some unlimited brunch deal whereby if you paid around $40 you could get unlimited food and drinks (no thanks, but still a great deal!). The atmosphere is very nice, very attractive fans on the ceilings, the room is very appealing and there is also a 2nd floor patio (no one was out there on the day we were there, too hot). We ordered the tuna ceviche to share to start, very delicious, I would highly recommend this.

"485575","Bono_Trattoria",5,"review_494526614","A sumptuous and genuine taste of Umbria","We discovered Bono in an unexpected place: Todi, Italy, a tranquil hill town in Umbria, Tuscany's hot sister. The father of one of Bono's proprietors (Luca Valeriani) lives in Todi and has encouraged the Americans there to eat at his son's trattoria in New York. We called a couple weeks in advance (Bono doesn't take reservations) and chatted with Luca, who was very friendly and gracious. He was going to be away on vacation, but let his colleague Graziella know we were coming. Graziella treated us (my wife, daughter, son-in-law and I) so warmly. The menu -- a blend of Luca's Umbrian flavors and Graziella's Sicilian touch -- is amazing! We shared grilled octopus and bruschetta appetizers, both of which were sumptuous. The pastas -- we had the strangozzi (a hearty Umbrian pasta) with shrimp and the pappardelle with cinghiale (wild boar) -- are handmade and light, yet substantial enough to stand up to seafood and cinghiale. The skirt steak is juicy, cooked to perfection and marinated in a savory blend of garlic, olive oil and spices. The sauteed chicken cutlet with lemon was simple, moist and exquisitely seasoned. We didn't get to try the pizza, but the brick oven tells me that it's done in the Neapolitan style (with an Umbrian twist) and is undoubtedly incredible. For those who have been to Umbria, Bono's simple but elegant cuisine will make you feel as though you are there again. If you haven't been to Umbria, one meal at Bono will put the green heart of Italy on your bucket list. We can't wait to go back -- to Umbria and to Bono. Grazie to Luca and Graziella for this absolute gem of a trattoria.",2017-06-20,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_37657"

"249470","Casa_Mono",5,"review_746404383","The only Spanish restaurant we bring our relatives/guests to dine in","It was love at first bite of their pan con tomate 10 years ago. Since then, we judge a Spanish restaurant by their pan con tomate and we can say it's average for most of the Spanish restaurants in town. Not here though. From starters to dessert, food was superb. This is the only place we bring our relatives from Madrid to. We haven't been in a while and this was our first time since Mario Batali was bought out from his restaurant ventures so we decided to check it out. The 5 star rating is for the food which remains excellent. I am willing to overlook some deficiencies like lackluster service and restricted space (the place is tiny perhaps a 15-seater exclusive of the bar area). It used to be open only in the evenings so reservations are not as hard to get as before. It's tapas style so don't expect to get stuffed but the harmony of flavors will satisfy you. Food is Spanish fusion but not of the showy pretentious avant garde style. Unusual combinations of flavors somehow work like the bacalao croquetas with orange aioli, baby squid with roasted cipollinis, sobresada with quince marmalade. We also liked the mackerel crudo, skirt steak, lamb belly and two desserts: the bread pudding and crema catalana. With a bottle of a crisp Albamar, this set us back by about $90 each for 3 people.

A great deal, especially considering their prix fixe menu includes most of the classic dishes I named here. Also, if you do need to make a small substitution, they will charge a very fair $3 fee. - Their French wines by the glass are very sensibly priced at $10 - $12/glass and the selection is pretty good, including nice Bistro pairings like Georges Duboeuf Pouilly-Fuisse & Louis Jadot Bourgogne Pinot Noir. -The quiet dining room, accessorized with colorful French Country oil paintings, copper pots and rich, dark wood furnishings, creates the perfect French Bistro atmosphere, which is also very warm and romantic.  -The service is very good too.

The menu has a three-part special that sounded great - so I decided to try it: beet salad, skate, then dessert. Dining alone as my lunch partner was called to another meeting, I was seated at a corner table in the DR area. I sat on a banquette. Very comfortable, the atmosphere is beautiful. A server came and removed 2 other place settings; a menu was provided. Water was brought to the table; I indicated that I would like some. After ordering, bread was brought to the table with butter. The butter was spreadable - very nice. Don't you just hate cold, hard butter to spread on great bread? This worked - great bread, great butter. I'd drunk half of the water, and had a difficult time getting refills. A server passed by with a water pitcher in his hand and just passed me! The next one caught my eye and filled my glass. That would be one area for improvement - to have servers check a whole area for refill waters. The food was spectacular - both artistically and taste-wise. I'd return in a heart-beat. Servers, however . . . they'd reach over the (empty) table since they were already in the aisle and serve/clear, rather than coming to my side and pulling/putting down plates, flatware from my side, which would have been less intrusive and better service. There was no one seated next to me - it was an empty table. There was plenty of room. But the servers were taking the path of least resistance for them - they're walking down the main aisle, and heaven forbid that they leave that pathway to provide better service to a customer! So, while the food is over-the-top, five-stars, the service is but three-stars. Servers are ""cutting corners.""

There are so many choices and it's hard to see the sign listing them out (not to mention the staff doesn't seem to be particularly patient, but the tastiness of the bagel makes it worth it). It is important to note that the bagel express line is strictly for bagels-- a bagel with cream cheese on it is a ""sandwich"" and you have to wait in the long line. However, I was able to order just a bagel with a side of cream cheese, so I cut it and put the spread on myself after I had left the restaurant. (They may be willing to cut the bagels at the express line, but the lady taking my order was a bit snippy so I was afraid to ask).

This place is so popular, you NEED to set up a reservation. It's popular for a good reason...the food was OUTSTANDING, the service was EXCELLENT, and the whole experience of cooking your own food on the grill built into the table was really, really cool! Our reservations were for the same time as when Happy Hour pricing ended - 6:00 pm. Despite that, they honored the Happy Hour pricing for the first two drinks that my wife and I ordered. I didn't even ask for it! My daughter had the Kalbi short rib, and absolutely loved it. My wife and I ordered the Kobe Style Dinner Course for 2 people, and it was insanely delicious. Since it was a special occasion, we let my son order the most expensive beef on the menu - the Wagyu. After I took a bite of his, I really felt like throwing down the ""I'm your parent"" trump card and taking his dinner from him...the taste was beyond heaven...truly THE most impressive beef that I'll ever have in my life. All of us split an assorted veggie plate to grill which complemented the beef nicely, although the ears of corn weren't that good, possibly because it's not corn season in the middle of February.

We did the Playwright on our last night and I hate to say, but it was pretty lacklustre. The bartender was not attentive and seemed more interested in not doing dishes than selling pints. Every time we had an empty glass, we would set it down so he could see it but he never asked if we wanted another. I always want another. So we had to ask every time which is clearly not the end of the world, but kind of annoying. My favourite time was when he walked by and I ordered another but I still had a bit of beer in my glass, he asked me to finish what I had so he didn’t have to use another glass. I told him I will bring my own next time. He was actually a pretty cool guy, just bothers me when people seem inconvenienced while doing there chosen profession. I ordered a turkey club and I was disappointed to see it had turkey lunch meat on it, not actual shaved turkey. Other than that, it was actually pretty good. My girlfriend had the steak sandwich and the meat was really tough. She does like it cooked medium well but the actual meat was tough and chewy. Wouldn’t recommend that one. Bar is kinda cool overall but we only sat on the main floor. Looks like there are other floors with other places to sit and we did not check them out. Main floor bathroom was a little sketch.

I'm usually forgiving of someone having a bad day, however multiple servers and even the manager displayed such poor service skills, I just can't find much leniency for what transpired.  First, our waitress was brand new. Though she was nice, she really didn't know the menu well nor did she always present the food correctly, calling certain dishes by different fishes. When you are paying 20 dollars for an appetizer, you want to know they are giving you what you ordered. Second, the bus boys kept clearing plates before we were finished with the food. In the nicer restaurants where quite frankly the portions are small, you want to enjoy all of it. We ordered nine different appetizers to share and 7 drinks so we were certainly inflating our tab. Third, our waitress presented the dessert menu without offering entrees or the possibility of more appetizers or sushi. So we ordered three desserts and fruit sake. Once again, the bus boys cleared the dishes before we were finished. He even tried to clear the sake glasses when they were half full. I had to verbally stop him as this was becoming intolerable! Fifth and most appalling was when the head bus boy set the table with new flatware for the next patrons, WHILE WE WERE STILL SITTING THERE! Not only is that completely rude and obnoxious, but that is extremely unhygienic and there were some scattered empty tables around the restaurant. Its not like we weren't ordering food the entire time as our bill was 465.00 BEFORE gratuity.  Last, as we were leaving, I asked for the manager. I let her know I would be reaching out to her as there were some concerns I had. With little concern she handed me her business card and didn't offer any assistance at that moment. Being in the service industry myself, it is well known that a good manager never lets a customer walk out the door feeling unhappy.  Sure the food is good, but its NYC and good food is easy to find around every corner. If I'm dropping more the $500 on a dinner, I expect better service. Interestingly enough, you will note that NOBU has not received any real awards since 2006 and with customer experiences like mine, I can understand why.

"349431","Angelo_s_of_Mulberry_Street",2,"review_204012063","Overpriced and mediocre, at best","My friend and I were searching for a good lunch in Little Italy. We stopped by Angelo's for some eggplant parmesan. $90.00 later, yes, I said $90.00 for lunch for two with no wine or beverage other than water. We left totally disappointed and very sorry we didn't stop at a different restaurant across the street that offered eggplant parmesan for lunch for $12.95 First, our waiter dropped off a basket of dry, overcooked pieces of bread and a bottle of olive oil. The olive oil had a terribly bitter after taste and did nothing to enhance the hard, tasteless bread. Our appetizer was one order of tomato and fresh mozzarella cheese for $15.50. We each had two slices of tomato and one slice of mozzarella cheese on our plates and a sprig of basil. No dressing, no presentation. The eggplant parmesan was not on the menu, but the waiter said they could prepare it, so we ordered it at $26.00 each. It tasted fine, but portion was a bit scant for $26.00 I asked for a side of spaghetti for us to share, since the eggplant parmesan didn't have anything else with it. When the bill arrived, we noticed our bowl of spaghetti, with a scant spoon of sauce cost us $22.00! When we questioned the $22.00 side, the waiter brought over the menu to show us that they don't have side dishes, and instead we were charged for an order of spaghetti. Ridiculous as it literally was a bowl with a spoonful of sauce on it. He said he would take $10.00 off the bill, but when he ran our credit cards, we noticed he didn't deduct the $10.00 from the bill after all. Do your purse a favor and try a different restaurant in Little Italy.",2014-05-04,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_194269"

They let us settle in over a bottle of wine while we collected ourselves and dried off a little bit. Service was excellent and very accommodating. The menu is extensive with something for everyone. We had appetizers with generous portions - stuffed mushrooms, baked clams, and calamari were excellent. The waiter was very knowledgeable and able to make recommendations - he was also able to suggest/make adjustments to menu items to suit individual tastes. Everything arrived exactly as ordered and was delicious. In particular, I had the best chicken piccata that I have ever had - the sauce was perfect. The wait staff checked in - made sure drinks were filled - but did not rush us at all - we were able to spend a leisurely 2.5 hours over dinner talking and catching up. Cappuccino over dessert was also excellent and tiramisu was delicious - the only fault was that my cannoli was average. This is a small place, we ate inside in close quarters - but were able to have good conversation and struck up a nice conversation with the people at the table next to us.

Some reservations are a good idea. Their expresso bar was a bit confusing. I stood in the wrong place and no one bothered to say anything. But the coffee and pastry was worth the wait. My husband enjoyed the gelato but said it was not as good as any he has tasted in Italy. Loved perusing the fresh produce, cheese, breads, specialty products. Had to hold myself back from buying too much. You can order on line and I was pleased to have seen the store and know they will have items not available in our local markets. Be prepared for ""upscale"" prices. Friends traveling with us thought it was very overpriced and not worth the effort. But we all agreed our lunch selections with wine were very good.

Last year I was seated upstairs, this time I was in the main dining room - a nice change but a tad more formal feeling (that's not a complaint). I started with a martini and a couple slices of their ""to die for"" raisin bread. For my starter I decided on a classic Caesar Salad and asked them to be sure to include a couple anchovies. When the salad came it looked like I got almost a whole tin :). That's ok - I'm one of those people who actually like anchovies! For my entree I repeated what I had last year: Cannelloni au Gratin (a combination of Beef, Veal and Sweet Pork Sausage rolled in a French Crepe with a Sherry Flavored Tomato Cream Meat Sauce). It was delicious - just as I remembered. I finished off my meal with Creme Brulee and coffee. Sardi's probably has a rep as a tourist trap but I would not agree.

Service is assiduous, even too much so. The wine list is extraordinary, featuring a huge range of Italian wines and a lot of champagne. I'm suspicious of anywhere Which offers ANY single bottle at over 750 dollars, even if it is Krug. I bet the prosecco was over my personal £30 a bottle limit too. But I wasn't paying and didn't look. The antipasti were delicious: my fried artichoke with lemon particularly so. Our table split with half going for pasta and the others for the duck breast, which they said was excellent. My pasta with zucchini and pecorino was only OK- the courgette sauce being very green but not so flavoursome. But mum's with tomatoes but I can't recall what else, was ace. It was the pudding course which really stood out. My corn and blueberry sundae was one of the best desserts I have ever eaten. The combination of salt in the corn and the sweetness of the fruit and mascarpone ice cream plus the texture contrasts just made it delectable.

Finally after ignoring it for a couple of days, my wife and I finally went in, and were very pleasantly surprised at not only how expansive it is (just keeps going and going), but also in the vast range of offerings that were represented. We've spent a lot of time in various types of markets in Italy, as well as specialty cheese shops, bakeries, butchers, etc...and this was like having all the best of them under one roof.  It was definitely crowded and a bit chaotic, but it's popular for a reason, and no more crowded and chaotic than any big market places I've been to in Italy.  Would definitely recommend it to pick up some food and take it across the street to Madison Square Park.",2017-09-18,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_94924"

We ordered slices of the artichoke pizza, their signature pizza and I can't believe I've never had this pizza before - it was amazing!

The brunch is such a great deal and was a really fun experience! Although not a party brunch (which I wasn't looking for), they play good music and it's a very festive atmosphere. We saw many large groups celebrating birthdays and bachelorettes. For $45 (plus tax & tip), you get unlimited food and drinks for two hours. Since there were 9 of us, we asked them to just bring us everything and they were happy to do so - telling us we can reorder anything we like. SO MUCH FOOD - and it was all SO good! Some of the standouts for our group were the Maya Benedict (my personal favorite), the empanadas, the chicken tacos and the chicken enchiladas. Oh, and the Maya hot dog was surprisingly good too! I'm sorry I do not remember our water's name, but he was very attentive and quick to bring out new drinks and food upon request. I've experienced unlimited brunches before where the wait staff is not so quick to bring out refills, especially when the place is as packed and busy as Maya was, but that was not the case here. We definitely got our money's worth in those 2 hours :) The drinks were also very good, strong and not watered down at all, and I love that they have so many options included with the bottomless deal. I stuck with the Maya Mimosa (with blood orange and passion fruit purees) and my friends tried out the bloody Mary, the sparkling sangria and the rest of the mimosa flavors. We loved them all!

Everyone is warmly welcomed, which adds to the initial congestion, but this is the charm of the establishment. We had a big lunch so we tried to eat a small portion. That did not work well as my wife ordered the Scallops and I opted for the Lasgane (101 layers!) The entrees were tasty!  We skipped apps, with an eye on desert - great decision! The limoncelo pie and the chocolate mouse were both but winners! We loved the experience. Our server Matt was fun, knowledgeable and did not rush us on a very busy Friday night in December.  Already planning next year's trip!  Tips: Reservations are a must and honored on a timely basis! The place is tight, typical NYC.

Real old world Italian but certainly not production line. Each dish seemed to be hand crafted and had some local touch to it. In our group, the dinners included veal, fish and pasta dishes. Each of us remarked how pleased we were with our dinners. With regard to wine, while they had a pretty good wine list with some reasonably priced quality wines, I asked the waiter about the house chianti and he said it was good. We ordered a carafe that was much cheaper than chianti I saw on the wine list and it was great. We actually wanted more and were about to order a half carafe.

It tasted like a hybrid of vinegar and fruity acid. I’ve never had any wine taste so awful in my life. When we informed the waitress that the bottle clearly was past its prime, she responded with a rebuttal that was along the lines of “it can’t be bad, we served hundreds of guests this very wine today”. Her attitude was quite displeasing. While they got us different wine, her whole pretentious demeanor was offputting. I wish she tasted the wine so she could see for herself. As for the food, the wagyu beef dumplings tasted more like sausage dumplings, the edamame dumplings were soggy (and came quite late) and the sushi was plain average. In fact, the toro was actually quite fishy, I’ve never had to force down toro before, I was a little nervous I might get ill that night but thankfully I was fine. Like I said, the rest of the sushi was very average and nothing special at all. I can get better sushi in my suburban neighborhood here in Virginia. The one dish that we did enjoy was the lobster.

It was all excellent and a perfect New York dinner. Cost for the two of us was US$114 so not cheap as burgers go but worth every cent.

The room is beautiful as others have said. I'm always a bit leery about celebrity restaurants both as to chefs and clientele (the paper Sunday said Jerry Seinfeld is a regular) particularly in NYC. I'm always afraid visitors will be treated as one-time tourists rushed through for an early or late seating. Instead we received efficient, professional and understanding service from the day we phoned 30 days ahead for a prime time table through the printed menus and cookies to take with us. Yes, this is fine dining so the service is by professional waiters as it should be, but they and the rest of the staff were engaging if you engaged them. The lower noise level allowed for conversation but the service and atmosphere weren't stuffy or snooty. We had the five course menu, the other choice is eight courses but the table next to us confirmed the portions were large. We splurged on the wine pairings which complemented our choices nicely. We also splurged on the seasonal truffle pasta dish which was outstanding. My veal chop was one of the best ever though my wife's pork was just a bit of a letdown by comparison. Yes it is expensive but worth every penny. They warmly accommodated our seating request for a table where we could sit next to each other given the special birthday occasion. Del Posto has earned the reputation it holds as one of the best restaurants in NYC and in the country for this type of fine Italian dining with a creative flair. We look forward to returning on a future trip to NYC.",2013-11-04,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_21638"

We have eaten at other Jean-Georges restaurants and always enjoyed them. This is a farm to table menu making it a little different.  We went on a Monday afternoon right when they opened because we did not have a reservation. I suggest reservations if you plan to go there. Even on a Monday, we waited a good hour before we were seated.  There were several large tables that people seemed to reserve for having special events. We were seated in a row of 2 seat tables. You will love it or hate it. You get to know the people on both sides of you very well. Everyone was friendly exchanging recommendations off the menu.  We asked the waitress what her recommendations would be and we took all but one of them which turned out to be good, just not as good as the rest. We started with the roasted kabocha squash toast, and the Roast Carrot And Avocado Salad. The toast was surprisingly our favorite. Very tasty. Wish it were warm however. Our main meals were Kasha & bowtie pasta with veal meatballs and the raw diver scallops. The Kasha and bow tie pasta was our least favorite item ordered, but still good. Just not as good as the rest. We finished off with the Salted caramel ice cream sundae w/ candied peanuts & popcorn which he serves at other restaurants and we love!  Overall, we enjoyed the experience. The service was good, but slow so you can truly enjoy each course. It was probably a little too slow for us. We were there over 3 hours with our wait and the meal.

I hosted some friends for lunch after not being able to get a dinner reservation. I would recommend dining for lunch and then walking your lunch ""off"" through a very cool neighborhood. The service is second to none, from the charming hostess (L.A.’s loss is NYC’s gain…) to the wait staff and the busboys. We started with the just made in-house mozzarella, salami and garlic bread - perfection. We are still talking about the garlic bread, like all the dishes at Carbone, simple ingredients done perfectly. We had the Caesar, baked clams, meatballs, rigatoni vodka pasta, cherry pepper ribs, veal parmagiana, and the lobster Fra Diavolo. These were not complex dishes but the flavor was beyond delicious. The best Caesar we have tried, ever. We are STILL talking about the rigatoni vodka. Also, I challenge you to find a better meatball anywhere. The ribs were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The veal parm was a classic in the best sense of the word. I would not opt for the lobster Fra Diavolo during my next visit.

We were told we could still sit at the bar but that the speed of sushi would be a bit fast. ""Can't be any faster than at Jiro's"" I muttered- and it wasn't. In fact we had our 20 pieces in about an hour and it was the perfect pace (but we had also endured being on a plane for 5 hours and were a bit hangry, to say the least). Chef Nakazawa makes all your sushi if you sit at the counter, and will tell you what each piece is, and maybe a little story if you're lucky. For the mackerel course, we were offered 3 different types of Mackerel, the first being Spanish. It was soft and melt-in-your-mouth. I can't remember the other 2 but when he asked which was my favorite, I told him the first piece and he said, ""Ah, you pick the cheapest one!"" Ha! So much for my expensive taste! (My husband would like to disagree here). He was very smiley and interactive, not like the austere sushi chefs you find at some other places (cough, Masa, cough). Would DEFINITELY recommend you go if you're in NYC and lucky enough to score a seat at the sushi bar (M-F only though, he doesn't work weekends).

We would like the opportunity to make this right and appreciate your feedback. Please reach out to us at questions@lepainquotidien.com so we can have the opportunity to make this experience up to you."" I immediately emailed them at the address provided, and have received no response after four days, so I can only assume they are only replying publicly to save face and have no real intention of remedying the situation.  Here follows the review which I posted, and still stand by: I very rarely feel compelled to write reviews, but our experience today was so abysmal that I felt a moral obligation to rack my brain for my login information.  We arrived and seated ourselves as the sign indicated. I am not a fan of big windows where pedestrians can gawk at diners, but we found a suitable table.  Anyway, onto what made this experience truly horrible, and unfortunately, memorable: We had been sitting at our table for about twenty minutes, and though several waitstaff passed by us, some even giving eye contact, we were not acknowledged--even as one of perhaps only three occupied tables. We finally had to wave down a server and we placed our order. A bit later, my dining partner was served his tiramisu and hot chocolate (both of which were tasty, so no qualms with the actual food). It was strange that my pain au chocolat was not delivered at the same time, considering the ones they serve are pre-made. Still, we decided to wait patiently for my food to be served. About fifteen minutes passed before our server approached us to let me know that they were out of pain au chocolat. Would I like brioche instead? No, I would prefer a plain croissant. Oh, we're out of that too. But would you like brioche? NO, I WOULD NOT LIKE BRIOCHE. I KNOW YOU WANT ME TO SURRENDER AND ORDER BRIOCHE, BUT I DO NOT WANT BRIOCHE. I said no thank you. She left immediately, even though I was going to ask if the cinnamon croissant roll was available. Oh well.  So my dining partner and I shared the tiramisu (which was clearly too small for two), and no-one came back to ask me if I would like anything else.  I waved to a server, intending to ask about another pastry, but she came over and asked if we wanted the check. Exasperated, I said that would be great. She brought the check and handed it to my dining partner, who happens to be a man. Even though I was the one who asked for the check, and I was treating my dining partner. To add insult to injury, there were suggested tip amounts printed on the receipt. The lowest option was 18%.  If they want to do this European thing of ignoring customers, that's fine. But they shouldn't expect American-style tipping.  All in all, it was a dreadful experience, and though the food that we actually received was tasty, the waitstaff's negligence left a bitter taste in our mouths.",2017-11-06,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_209424"

If you call pitbull, Rihanna, Katy Perry and so on rock music then you may like it. Music was so loud it was like sitting in revolutions or oceana for a sit down meal I asked what the local legendary burger was as for whatever reason they had printed the default menu which says ""the local legendary burger is different and unique to each hard Rock Cafe"" the menu should have a description of their own speciality burger. The lady replied pointing at a picture ""it's like that one with a bit of apple in it and some jam"" I decided to have it anyway but unfortunately she's only gone and brought me the bog standard legend burger. I wasn't going to wait another 20 minutes so just put up with it The experience was ruined from the loud club mixes they kept playing and we couldn't hear ourselves speak. Food quality was laughable compared to any other hard Rock Cafe. (cheese on burger was pre melted but left for a while before it got to me so was almost hardened, pub food standard at best) Honestly since looking at trip advisor it's got the same kind of reviews since 2015 so nothing is changing. Take my warning and avoid, or if you collect the t shirts like me just use the rock shop and dash out for an arbys instead.

Wedding Anniversary dinner… they asked when we made the reservation a few weeks earlier, if this was a special occasion, and made a note to do a little special thing for us at the end of the meal …VERY NICE !! and Thank you, all !!! So, on a hot July evening, enter through the hotel lobby and escape the realities of the times in America. The large space offers views of the street and also 5th Avenue below through enormous arched windows, and private nooks for a more private experience on the other. The décor is luxuriant and very pleasant: each room has its own unique style and décor, with low lighting, parquet flooring, carpets, long drapes, luxurious wallpapers, art deco panels and soft furnishings that keep the atmosphere a subdued but grand calm, almost like being in a private home. The sublime ambiance allows one to fully experience one’s evening in luxury and comfort, without being drowned out by the neighboring tables. Price are in the low- to mid-stratosphere: appetizers are $16 to $23 and mains are $24 to $65, while the sides are $12 (all..) ! Desserts ? - $15. And drinks ? Fuhggeddaboudit !! Not the everyday dinner, but the preparations here are possibly worth the price. Clement also offers several pairings and set combinations, which are best left to be explored another time. We were there for a celebration, (..they asked) and were gracious enough to give us a complementary small sweet and cheese plate to mark the occasion. Thank you !! So, it was a pleasant evening: long drive to the City in the Saturday evening traffic, a struggle to find parking nearby, and then a fine dinner followed by another struggle to find where we left the car, and a long drive back to the ‘burbs. But tomorrow’s a sleep-in day….  The lobster bisque is really incredible: very lobstery and smooth, with chunks of meat, in a deep, creamy broth. And crispy octopus is a treat when well cooked, as this was: crispy edges and tender, succulent inners, with a hint of lemony-sea. For mains: Dover Sole and Rack of Lamb.. both excellent, and a fair portion per serving. Soft and easy cut on the knife, and an easy bite. Not overcooked ~ or under, as then lamb can be gamy. The portion size in both was just enough, so one isn’t stuffed or hungry after ~ and they aren’t pushing a second order afterwards.

We went after viewing the SHOES Exhibit at the (free) museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. The Tipsy Parson across the street had an hour wait, so we came by Bocca di Bacco (""Mouth of Bacchus"") by accident. The spare near-black interior is a bit too dark for my taste. Probably works better at night--although some would love it. Service came with a smile, which was nice for a change. Many gay customers (also nice for a change).  We had Bellinis. First the waiter told us they would be $12 each; then he came back and told us they would be $13. Weird. What were we supposed to say, ""No. We'll have a $12 drink instead, please""? They were small for $13 and two of them cost more than our main dishes. The frittata alla peperonata (frittata with sweet peppers, onions and mozzarella) was duly cooked well done per my request, and the portion was medium-sized, but plenty. There seemed a lot of eggs and not enough accompanying ingredients, but what was there was very good. The greens on the side were fresh, but the dressing was nothing to write home about. Le Pain Quotidien's is better, frankly. So our visit was not particularly memorable, but it was a convenient substitute for The Tipsy Parson. N.B. The restrooms were new and quite beautiful, in grey and black glass tile complimented with scarlet-rust smaller tiles for a little punch. My guy friend raved about it, but for me the color combo was a bit too severe. The pics of the food on their website are stunning -- a lot better looking than the food we received. I think we overpaid. Another N.B. Christine Quinn, head of the NYC Council, was seen there on March 1st, according to the NY Post.

We have never gotten a meal that wasnt up to par. The juicy burgers are cooked to your perfection everytime. Large portions are loaded with a side of delicious fries.(for a small fee, ask for tuscon fries instead,they are lightly coated with gratred cheese) The fried pastrami and pickle appitizer is unbelievable (if you like pastrami) It sounds odd I admit, but try it once and you'll be craving it for sure. The sushi is fresh, the milk shakes are true old fashion milkshakes. The tuna burgers are wonderful! It is actually a generously sized piece of tuna steak on a roll. The wasabi, ginger mayo that tops this ""burger""is an unbelievable treat. The lobster roll sliders are very freshand good, as well as the the paprika salmon. I must admit we never have room for dessert because we overindulge in the appitizers and entrees. Honestly they are in such a hurry to get you in and out, you begin to wonder if you dissed dessert or if you were dismissed. The atmosphere is robust with music, hustle, bustle and patrons of all ages. The bar is large and quite pretty...as serves up wonderful old and new drinks perfectly. Although I didnt care for the Citrus Cooler. The decor is reminicent of an old time resturant. Booth seating with black & white tiled walls. In the warmer months there is outdoor seating. I wish the attention to the quality of food they served was matched with the attention they give the patron here. We have been here several times, with different people. One time we were ""honored"" with a personable waitress. The wait staff on the whole. makes you feel as if they are doing you a favor by serving you. Thye are not attentive, or helpful in suggestions. The bus staff however is wonderful. Thye should promiote them to waiters and demote the waiters to busing tables. They don't seem to want to be bothered making diners happy. It seems as if they are just trying to get throiugh your table to turn it over to the next customers. Not really a great feeling when your siting there with no silverware or plate and your waiter comnitnually ignores your gestures to approach your table. If it wasnt for the great food, I am sure no one would go back based on the service. My opinion about the wait staff is based on 10 seperate visits. One waitress out of 10, was really superb. I waited to write this review purposely, thinking it would change. Other patrons we spoke to outside had the same comments about hte service. The ladies who seat you are on the same page as the waiters as well. They are all armed with the same robotic unpersonal mantra,"" 20 minutes to 45 for a table....next..""..Reservations are taken, but only for a small portion of the tables. So if you are planning on going make one. But if not, its not a big deal. The tables are turned over very quickly, so you really never wait very long.  Bravo on the food, thumbs down on waitstaff.....management please do something to step up your customer service.

We checked ahead making sue the resturant could take care of us as this was a big celebration for our group of 4. As soon as we walked in at 11:10 pm the waiter seated us and says the kitchen is closing in 20 minutes. We felt rushed! The staff did not explain the menu or drinks at all. There was no drink menu and the staff did not understand the drink I ordered for a full bar, that should have been easy. The waiter rushed our dinner and hit my elbow with one of the plates and did not say sorry. He said that only happens once. I said oh ok, I guess I did not need my elbow and it was ok for you to hit it with the plate. He snickered and walked away. I was not ok with that. The food though, was very good and steaks cooked to perfection. The service POOR! We paid for our meal and we left the tip deserving of poor service. The waiter approached us saying was the service not good. Normally people give an 18-20 percent tip. You did not. We explained that the service was not good and hitting my elbow and snickering I found disrespectful. (Still no apology) and he continued to tell us about our poor tipping manners. HA! We said something to the manager about the service and comments as well as the waiter hitting my elbow and he just said thanks for letting him know, and telling him about the isue but he didn't offer anything to make up for horrible service.

The Nonna's Meatballs, with creamy polenta and tomato sauce, was very delicious. What took it to yet another plane was the lovely roasted hot long pepper sitting astride the two meatballs.  The Calamiri Fritti somehow didn't measure up despite the accompanying parsley and lemon.  We ordered two pizzas, one with pepperoni and the other with cauliflower. While the toppings were flavourful the doughiness of the thick crust lowered the gustatory experience. And it was tough to cut or bite into them specially at the edges.  Our dessert of Chocolate Tiramisu was a large and very delicious treat which we shared amongst us.  One singular shortcoming of the place was that the tables are rather small and it's a struggle to keep the glasses, crockery and cutlery on it. The price points are okay considering its location but I don't know if I am going to really recommend it to friends.",2017-09-27,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_12093"

Granted, that's not always representative of what a restaurant has to offer, but still, we were disappointing by our meals. The appetizers (we all got the apple and blue cheese salad) were adequate as were two of the main courses: one steak & Frites, one coq au vin. The star was, by far, the duck breast. Crisp skin, juicy meat. Yum.   Desserts, however, were a major letdown. The almond cake was very dry and didn't pack a lot of punch. And the white chocolate creme caramel was a tasteless blog--accompanies by delicious red-wine poached pear and ginger ice cream. If only the creme caramel was gone and they added more pears and ice cream, that dish would have been heaven.   Service was just ok, not particularly attentive.  We expected better from DB.

We were not asked if we wanted more coffee/juice when our glasses were empty, this is something you come to expect with American hospitality. The waitress took our order and my brunch dish came out with Salmon which I did not ask for and really do not like. The waitress took the plate away and a replacement came out some 10 mins after. By this time my boyfriend had finished his brunch (albeit it was delicious). The second plate looked like it had been thrown together and was stone cold. Again I sent this back and the waitress was not apologetic however the manager did come and apologise. The item, as well as our coffees, were removed from the bill. All in all I was really disappointed as this was a real highlight restaurant when we visited in 2016. For the price you pay the service is not there anymore.

Why do they burn it? Crispy crust is great-but this was not crispy or fully cooked. We got there just when they opened and line formed in minutes. Figured it to be hot and great. It was cold. My sicilian square pie dough was undercooked but Bottom was burnt and not even crispy. Shows they don’t have right temps going on ovens. The only saving grace was the pepperoni. We picked it off.

The steamed dumplimngs lacked flavour (and seasoning). They came with lovely dipping sauces but you had to put them in those to make them taste of anything.  Waiters were either whipping empty dishes away with wild abandon making us feel pretty rushed or nowhere to be seen. It all felt a bit erratic / chaotic.

I ordered the grilled sea bass as a main course, but the waiter suggested I try the baked sea bass in a salt crust instead. I took his recommendation and was very glad I did. It was excellent! Just like in Italy the whole fish in the salt crust was presented before being taken away and filleted. Whoever did the filleting knew what they were doing...two whole intact fillets and not a single bone.

We booked for 7pm but when we arrived we had to wait for our table. So did three other parties - there was a big concert on in Carnegie Hall opposite. Clearly they had badly overbooked. At least they gave us a glass of Prosecco but we had to drink it standing up, crammed in by the check-in desk. Annoying though, as if they had told us when we booked (in person) we would have accepted a later reservation - the place cleared a lot by 7.30 (though it is always busy lunch and dinner). We were finally offered, and accepted, a table upstairs in the gallery: ""It's quiter and roomier there"". It was - but lacked the downstairs buzz and was somewhat claustrophobic with a low ceiling. Moral - don't go up there! Our waiter was not so hot: made lots of silly errors (eg mains arrived before the starters had been cleared, glass of red wine for the main course forgotten, no spoons for dessert, brought an incorrect bill which he then substituted). The bar in the corner was covered in the dirty crockery fom the rush and was only cleared as we were leaving, with one of the waiters seen eating some of the leftovers! Neither the manager nor his sidekick came upstairs all the time we were there - they should, to smarten things up. As for the food, the antipasti were really good and you may do best by sticking to these and the pizzas. My scallopine of veal with marsala was fine, but my partner's veal turned out to be - though it was not so described - also a scallopine. So it was very thin, breaded with some cheese and ham, and gigantic: it was hanging over the side of the plate. There was no sauce, just some salad so it was very dry and flavourless, and monotonous to eat. It was left! We knew it was not the cheapest place for what you get, but on this evening it was a huge disappointment and definitely poor value for money.

There was a rep from the drinks company there selling the flavoured rum and whiskey he brought and the waitress brought over cheese and olives and then in turn 3 of the 6 promised cocktails over the space of 90 minutes. After that we left underwhelmed.  For $12 it seemed OK value but the service was not attentive and they should of kept the cocktails coming- they were too spaced out.

Recently, on a beautiful September evening, intending to go somewhere else, we noticed an open table on their outdoor terrace and decided to give it a try. To call their menu unconventional Italian is an understatement. So, if you are looking for recognizable Italian dishes, for the most part, you will not find it here. That is a definite charm of this place, serving such unique offerings as mussels in lemon parsley sauce, lasagna made with crepes instead of noodles, bread salad, etc. It actually took us a while to decide what to eat and we didn't veer too far into the unknown. For appetizers, we chose the buffalo mozzarella with san daniele prosciutto with stewed peppers and a farro salad with sundried tomatoes, artichoke hearts and parmigiano reggiano. Both were good, except the prosciutto was a little stringy. I've had better. The farro (grain) salad was different and enjoyable. For entrees, my wife had the buffalo ricotta lemon ravioli with shrimps and egg plant and I chose the potato gnocchi with fava beans, sausage and grated pecorino. The pastas were both homemade and melt-in-your mouth delicious. For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake and panna cotta with strawberries were both good, but the portions could have been a little more generous.  Gradisca is definitely an upscale Italian restaurant with service to match. Again, certainly not your run-of-the-mill Italian eatery, but if you are looking for something adventurous, by all means give it a try.",2013-09-16,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_17759"

In our early conversations we could see that there was a commitment from them to make this a wonderful occassion for us and our 50 guests. They provided terrific menu ideas and were very receptive and accomodating to items we wanted to have added. Pressure off! We knew we were in excellent hands. The day of the wedding we arrived and all was set up perfectly as we had discussed. The staff throughout the night were perfect - often remembering special requests from our guests. The bartenders were top notch and as with most celebrations, provided the perfect ingredient that helps 'strangers' become friends - even though most people knew of each other already.  Dan and I had had dinner a couple of times at ViceVersa before our wedding and knew that the quality of the food, the presentation and creativity with which the food was prepared, would add up to a successful night.

When he returned again, we had finished them but I mentioned the missing topping. He stated they must have run out. When our burgers came (we ordered the special, no specifications, just as stated on the specials board) they were missing green chiles. our server angain told us they were out. The kitchen/servers need to communicate to guests when an item cannot be made as described. That way, the guest can decide whether they still want said item.

Given Boulud’s rock-star status, we had high expections. We started with Wild Mushroom Crostini (my wife) and Tuna Tartare. Both good, tasty, although the mushroom topping on the crostini was a little heavy on the garlic. There was a SNAFU in the kitchen that delayed the arrival of our starters, a rather inauspicious start to the meal. For entrees, my wife had the special of the day, Cassoulet, while I had the Braised Lamb Pappardelle. Again, both were good. However, between the owner’s cachet and the $$$$ prices, we were expecting to be blown away with flavors and presentation. While very good, nothing at our table approached greatness.

"272731","Blue_Smoke_Flatiron",4,"review_148250671","Just when we thought they couldn't be worse... they totally redeem themselves!","BBQ in NYC? YBYA! After a luke-warm reception and an even chillier wait (always seems like forever when you don't have a cocktail in front of you) for the wait staff (pun apparently intended here at Blue Smoke), the food didn't disappoint. I think the first thing you learn when you become a waiter is to not put your hand over the glasses or in people's food. The second is to wash your hands. The third is to greet your guest immediately after they are seated. Get the coaster in front of them and start a drink order. Apparently they didn't get to the third thing. I thought I was in for a disappointing start to the evening. Turns out it was all up from there. We went with a couple of quick snacks. The eggs and the ravioli. The eggs were fantastic. Odd to say for a deviled egg, but they really were. Not too mustardy. Not too mayo-y. Tasted like an egg like you would want. The ravioli was forgettable. We skipped the appetizers and went straight for the main courses due to the overwhelming desire to eat all of the sides. Slaw was good - as good as you'll have in that style. The mac and cheese was a standout - when I think of BBQ joints I think of mac and cheese, but generally overcooked, mushy stuff. This was firm pasta. Great cheese sauce. And the perfect amount of roasting on the top. The brussel sprouts were anticipated, but fell short. Cook those in bacon like the rest of the free world! The cornbread, while plain and predictable, was delicate and slightly sweet. Quite good. For dinner, my better half went predictably with the chicken. It was well cooked, moist, tender and had great flavor. The mashed potatoes came with an added bonus of crispy onion strings. All hit big. The carolina pulled pork was great - and the portions were huge. Too much to eat. Unfortunately, by the time we made it through all of that we didn't even TOUCH the good stuff for dessert. And they had some great stuff it looked like. Next time, we start with the Apple Crisp. They were prompt when it came time to give them our money... but the food did make up for the poor first impression.

What had not changed was the quality. We had the ravioli special, which was simple but perfect. We had the fresh pasta with seafood -- the mussels and scallops were tender, the shrimp were firm and flavorful. The service was impeccable -- attentive but not intrusive. For a Manhattan restaurant, there was more space between tables than most locales. We ate downstairs again this time -- with an atrium ceiling, the noise from other tables diffuses pretty well. So while it was busy, and there were some full-energy patrons, it was not overwhelming. One did not have the sense of others being so close as to be forced into eavesdropping -- one's privacy was accorded respect. Were I to live in New York, this would be my go-to restaurant.

Then, because it was a little breezy/chilly I gave up my usual sidewalk seating and sat at the Antipasto Bar inside. At first, I wasn't in the mood for a salad type of experience but the more I looked over the selections, the more I knew I had to try a bunch (your choice of 3 or 5 selections). Of course, I went with five.

The menu has so many good choices it’s hard to choose and then the waiter tells you about all the specials! We were on a tight schedule prior to a performance but the wait staff and kitchen were very accommodating and we got out in plenty of time. When the basket of excellent bread arrived, hot from the oven, we knew we were in for a treat. We shared an appetizer of polenta with wild mushrooms; I thought my husband was going to lick the plate so as not to miss a morsel! I had homemade pappardelle with a seriously intense and wonderful lamb ragu. My husband had a special of lobster tail and shrimp on fettuccine with a vodka pink sauce. Both were delicious.

They cram the tables in here and service is friendly and efficient. The place was buzzing and waiters rushing around in and out of the kitchen. We had to wait at the bar for a short while for our table and manager keen to apologise for the delay so ordered the barman to offer us free Prosecco - we didn't argue. Authentic looking italian menu and spoilt for choice with starters so we ordered 3 or 4 different ones to share - sharing is the thing. Unfortunately the main courses of risotto and the pork cassoulet were rather disappointing but perhaps we were just a bit too full. Would probably come back again to soak up more of the atmosphere - and hope for more free prosecco.",2019-03-10,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_18277"

I didn’t ordered any food and I was happy about, after I joined the restroom - See picture.  This is nothing like „if there is any issue with the bathroom, please let us know“! It never should look out like this. I strongly believe the restroom should be checked every hours, this for sure during the rush hours. I was there around 4:30 pm. The second thing is. I wanted to pay by cash. But the waiter told me, sorry, we don’t accept any cash only credit card. I believe this i a not a way we should go.

I was craving french onion soup and found theirs good, not great. The biggest problem was some of those pieces of onion peel that get rather hard when cooked. I didn't even realize I had swallowed one, but it got caught in my throat and hurt until something else helped it down. My partner said he had found a few of the same pieces in his soup, but caught them before swallowing. I had the chicken paillard with arugula salad on top - the chicken needed a little more flavor, but the salad was fresh and full of nice veggies. My partner's steak frites also needed a little more flavor. Service was very good, not rushed. The apricot financier was well done - and just the right size for a dessert.

"229107","Don_Giovanni",1,"review_159479505","Worst ""Italian"" food ever!","We stepped into this restaurant looking for Italian food - what a mistake. I must say,that as a person from Europe, who has been to Italy several times, I have high expectations towards Italian cuisine. Maybe this is a culutral difference and this type of reastaurant is ""American- Italian"". But it doesn't change the fact that my mom got food POISONING after dining here. First of all, service was really poor. Our tables were dirty, waiter put our cutlery in wrong order and left a dirty fork on our table. Not to mention that after apetizers, he put cutlery we used directly on the table (without changing it, or at least putting them on a napkin). Than he FORGOT to bring meat balls to spaghetti with meat balls. Secondly, the food. Well, I must say if someone can ruin such a simple meal as caprese he can ruin anything. Well, they did it at Giovanni's. Tomatoes at my mom's caprese were diced and mixed with some kind of awful garlic salt. You couldn't even fell the flavor of tomatoes.YUK. Than the main dishes - all of us had pasta. Sauces were completly flaovurless, the same as parmesan cheese, for which I asked to add ANY flavor to these dishes. Portions are really big, none of us finished it (but mostly because of it's completly lack of taste). But the worst part was yet to come, when we finally got meat balls - AWFUL, like food in school cantinas. I can't even say the kind of meat they were made from. I can't find anything positive in this resaturant. Maybe it can work for people who care only about size of a meal. For others - ABSOLUTELY NO.

As we were waiting for the food to arrive, Daniel Humm even came out to meet us. The food was delicous and so pretty! The little 'surprise' dishes, as I call them, were a delight! Goat's cheese lollipop with beet marshamallow, chocolate and mint squares with sesame crisps and everything in between!  The atmosphere was wonderful!

While I won’t claim to be a jazz and/or big band ‘expert’ I believe I have standards high enough to know great music when I hear it. At the Friday night show I, along with dozens of others in the audience, enthusiastically cheered on a group of Musicians with a capital “M”! There was not one moment in their almost two hours of playing that did not disappoint. I made reservations well in advance and knew it was first-come, first-serve seating. I planned on lining up one-hour before seating, but thought the cold January day would keep the line short. Even with a crowd we still managed to get pretty good seats (although the place is small enough where there really isn’t a bad seat) with Tommy and his drums in plain view. As if Tommy and the BBB were not enough the evening we attended we were also treated to special guest Cuban percussionist extraordinaire Pedrito Martinez!  There is a $20 music charge and a $10 per person food/drink minimum. As a vegetarian I was nicely surprised by the tasty Birdland Vegetarian Burger while my friend enjoyed his Grilled Free Range Chicken Sandwich. The service was excellent as we were never bothered while the show was going on and did not run out of beverages.  Overall our experience at Friday’s Tommy Igoe and The BBB was a trip highlight and well worth the music and food charge- in fact, quite a bargain in my book. With the rotation of guest musicians and songs you can request to be played (via www.tommyigoe.com/birdland.htm) each show is unique and sure to give you the best live music show in town!

No apology and no manager came over other than Jeavon hoping food was better now.  Then wanted another cocktail and said this time put the Malibu into a separate cup. Jeavon agreed a good idea and way around the manager. He came back sheepishly and said still no go as barman said they already mixed up.  I ask for him to send the manager over. She came over (Lauren maybe her name) she had no idea steak sent back - not great for a manager. I asked about cocktail and she said they premix them. Thought whole point about a cocktail was they made fresh. She told me had permission to pre make each morning!!! Certain Outback standard is very different to that approach.

"66752","Avra_Madison_Estiatorio",4,"review_618962326","Avoid fish by the pound and observe the age gaps","I love Avra the original. The newer version, off Central Park is extremely modern and chichi. They clearly spent a lot of money putting together this very good Greek fish restaurant.  The appetizers are meant to be shared but they have shrunk the portion sizes unlike at their sister restaurant in the East 40s.  The wait staff will always try and flog you the imported Greek fish on display that is then weighed and charged accordingly. Yes, you can charge $100 for a fish that barely feeds 2 people. Add on sides and those yummy appetizers and a drink or two and it's break the bank account time.  Stick to the menu fish dishes. All are from $35-$49 which is typical of a NYC midtown fine dining establishment. One note on the clientele; the fish may be available by the pound but I suspect many of the 20 something women with 60 or 70 something men are available by the hour. Thus for some Avra 60th street has the most expensive fish in the world especially if you also indulge in ""desert."" I will come back as it certainly is a scene !

The SO and I got an old school round pie with prosciutto di parma and arugula; it was done in about 15 - 20 minutes.

My first plate was homemade veal & Spinach ravioli with cream mushrooms, prosciutto and entree of Hanger steak with potato cake, shallots and cabernet wine sauce. Dessert was the most amazing Tiramisu I've ever had. Ugh. So. Amazing. Lastly, the service was amazing, from the host that is constantly talking to the patrons to the multiple waiters that will accommodate your most mundane needs. Just amazing. Check out all my other reviews, I don't hand out 5 stars very easily. This was a well deserved 5 star review that would've received 6 stars if that were possible.",2013-03-15,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_18065"

You can get all different kinds. I think the corned beef is the famous one but I have to say I prefer the ""hot pastrami"". I find the corned beef is fattier and tends to be greasier. You need to be pretty hungry to have the usual sandwich and fries. The fries are the big wedge kind. They taste good but the only drawback is some of them are so big they tend not to get cooked all the way through. A small complaint but would prefer them to be cooked more for my liking. You also get a bowl of kosher and dill pickles as well as some fantastic coleslaw. And you have to have the Dr Brown Cream Soda... a New York delicacy!",2013-07-08,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_164733"

"420949","Brooklyn_Diner",3,"review_314307829","Very popular, very big portions, good food, on the pricey side, service a little disappointing","We came here for lunch and also breakfast. The place felt so busy I was surprised they could fit us in. We managed to flag down a waiter quite quickly and place our order but it was a good 15 minutes before our iced water turned up and 45 minutes before our burger did. The burger was actually a decent sized meal, not too big, not too many fries, but the cheesecake that followed...wow...I don't know why it had to be so huge there was no way the two of us could finish a shared cheesecake. When we asked for a white coffee, it just came black, so we asked for the milk and sugar, they turned up, but no teaspoon to stir it...so I gave up and used the handle of my dirty pudding spoon!  We really wanted to experience a NYC Sunday brunch, so we did try the diner again. We were only the second people in that morning but it soon filled up and by 10am was packed. Service was a bit better for breakfast although my ketchup never did turn up that I asked for... And no sugar for my coffee again...Oh well, perhaps I should give it up??! It seemed to be a very typical upmarket diner. There were New Yorkers, tourists, families and cops all enjoying a meal/drink there. I think maybe it needs a few more staff though as it struggles at busy times. The portions are generally way too big, so you end up paying top dollar for a meal then loads of it goes in the bin. I would recommend smaller portions and lowering the prices, but bring British that's what we are used to. I am starting to think that huge plates of food are what makes New York ...

Staff were really lovely and explained the dishes really well (I love my food so asked lots of questions that they were really happy to answer). We did the ""long story"" taster menu that was fantastic! The food was beautifully presented and tasted incredible. You can tell the chef is very passionate about his New Zealand heritage and he really expresses that through his food. Be warned though, there is course, after course, after course so make sure you go REALLY hungry before you get there and don't be tempted by too much bread or else you'll really be struggling by the end. There is a 'short story' which is a few courses less, but personally if it's a special occasion then you may as well go for the full monty! If you like red wine, then I recommend the Foxes Island Pinot Noir (2009).... delicious!!! All in all, if you are looking for a special meal in NYC then The Musket Room will not disappoint!

"354333","Blue_Fin",4,"review_155977023","Blue Fin Makes Times Square Bearable","If I were a preteen on a school trip to NYC, I might love Times Square. As it is, I see Times Square as the equivalent of an all-inclusive mass-market Caribbean resort - loud, tacky, gaudy, overbright, downmarket-but-overpriced, filled with screeching annoying people hell-bent on seeing The Lion King and eating at Applebee's. I pass through it only when I have to, and always with horror. So when Blue Fin at the W Hotel opened, I thanked my lucky stars.  I first ate at Blue Fin when some colleagues and I needed to find a place for a business lunch in or near Times Square - as soon as we walked in I felt relief at being in an adult, upscale-for-Times-Square-anyway restaurant (no, it's not Le Bernardin, but it doesn't need to be) that offered a comparative oasis of calm from the chaos outside. It's a large, attractive restaurant with the kind of vibe you expect from a W Hotel (cool, with lots of dark wood and glass and elements that make you think of water). There are two stories and multiple bars.  I can always find multiple items on the menu I want to order. In particular, I really like the sushi, and usually order that. My favorite sushi is at Masa/Bar Masa, but the sushi at Blue Fin has always been very tasty and fine too. Desserts are always reliably good too. The prices are reasonable for NYC.  In short, this has become my go-to place when I need to eat in or near Times Square, such as before a Broadway performance (not The Lion King ;)).  One tip: definitely make a reservation; they're not hard to get on OpenTable - which can lull you into a false sense of security regarding being able to walk in. Don't risk it. Sometimes you can walk in right away, but more often than not, waits can be long if you don't have a reservation.",2013-03-29,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_132838"

So depending on your table, you could have an evening with either one as a backdrop. The service is personable and efficient. They would not get very far if they made diners late for the opera, so this is one thing that's 100% guaranteed. The waiter was convinced I'd been there before. It certainly wasn't recent, if so, and I told him. He told me that he was similarly convinced with another diner, and when this one was sure he had not been there before, the waiter asked him his name. ""Newt Gingrich"" replied the diner. oops.  The food was on a high international level. Three of us had crab cakes, the best we'd ever had. Large pieces of crab fell out of a divine crust in a generously apportioned cake sitting on spicy mayo decorated with daikon slices. Two of us had veal tenderloin with gnocchi, beautifully arranged on a plate and perfectly roasted as ordered. The other two had branzino fillet, once again done to perfection. The convenience comes in part from leaving one's coats at one's table, and returning for dessert during intermission. The Grüner was in a refreshed ice bucket, water was poured, and the cheese was sitting on the table when we arrived; the chocolate soufflés arrived right after we sat down. It's Opera First Class. The only complaint I have about these people, and it IS a serious one, is that one can't reserve at the time one books the opera tickets.

We had an 8:00 reservation, arrived a few minutes early due to hunger pains, and we were told the reservation was at 8 so it would be a few minutes. No problem. At 8:20 I enquired about our table, was told it would be a few more minutes. At 8:30 was told the table was being set. 8:40 still setting the table. Was finally seated at 8:45 (amazing - 15 minutes to set a table!) and had lost all interest by this time. The hostess was rude, unhelpful and cared more about the regulars who arrived after us and were seated before us.  It's unfortunate because the waiter was very helpful, the food was good, a bit expensive for what it was but within the realm of fine NY steakhouses.

The live music and restaurant atmosphere made up our minds. As soon as we were seated, were were offered the wine list; it had a wonderful homemade bottle of red wine for $16. That started the meal off great. We then ordered a hot antipasto- generous portions of mozzarela sticks, breaded eggplant and clams... The bread was fantastic- with a little olive oil drizzled on it.

We arrived at the restaurant almost 30 minutes ahead of my scheduled reservation and asked if we could be seated early. The host immediately said, ""of course"" and asked if we'd like to be seated at the bar, or at a table. We opted for the table and no sooner had we been seated than our waiter approached, greeting us warmly and asking if we'd been to Fig and Olive before. After stating that we hadn't, the waiter explained the menu to us, indicating some of his personal favorites, as well as some items that many customers considered to be their favorites. I was impressed to see that it wasn't the most expensive items that he was pointing out! We ordered our beverages and decided that we just wanted to share a few appetizers, so we could try several things. The waiter was very pleased and commented that we made a great choice, because we could sample many items and would know what Fig and Olive was all about. He also brought over a sampling of 3 different olive oils with breads and described each to us in detail. Every employee that came in contact with us was extremely pleasant and friendly. We had such a wonderful time and wished we'd had the opportunity to return there before leaving town. I still dream about the restaurant, the food, the ambiance, the service...it was a perfect evening. Unfortunately, we had theater reservations so we weren't able to linger as long as we'd have liked. I will absolutely return there when I return to NYC and I will (and do) tell everyone how wonderful it was. My only small issue is the size of the tables, they are very small, especially if you have more than 2 appetizers, but that's to be expected in NYC, and when it's busy and crowded, the noise level is very high.",2012-06-04,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_39217"

The restaurant can get a little loud, I dont mind it but just FYI. We usually come here at 7:30pm on a saturday night. For some reason everytime we come, they do not open the doors until 7:30pm and you have to wait outside. They dont even let you go in for a drink and wait at the bar which is strange.

We ordered burrata with salsa verde, a fabulous combination of flavors and textures. You must try it. WE also had the mussels escabeche with burnt toast, a flavor bomb that will not be duplicated in any restaurant ever. We also had the endive with walnuts and anchovies, an impossibly strange combination but it was as good a combo of tastes as I have ever had. Don't go there w/o trying it. We had the lamb ribs with greens that was similar to chimichuri but more subtle and with homey. It was so good that I wish there were twice as many ribs. Our only disappointment was the pork which was too salty and didn't quite work. We had the panna cotta for dessert which again ended the meal without the memory of the above courses. It was OK.

"99671","Union_Square_Cafe",3,"review_333094378","The staff heroically tried to overcome the shortcomings of the final menu","The restaurant is now closed. My note is really about the future Union Square Café (USC). We are a weekly regular at USC. After having our final dinner at USC this week, we are concerned what Danny Meyer and his management team are planning to do with the menu once USC reopens. The final prix fixe menu was a disaster for us and other regulars. The waitstaff did everything they could to make us happy within the confines of the menu and what the kitchen was willing to do. For the first time we heard the word ""no"" as the operative word for the evening. We are all very concerned that this is where the menu will be moved to once the restaurant reopens. All of the regulars that we spoke to are looking forward to returning, but will not if this menu becomes the new norm.  The new non-tipping policy is not something ourselves or most of the regulars we spoke to over the last few months, are happy with. We all have developed relationships with the waitstaff who strive and have succeeded to make our experiences at the restaurant terrific. I understand the issues USC faces with pay in the back of the house. However, it is the front of the house that interacts with the customers and has worked very hard over the years with USC’s customers to ensure we have a good experience. We reward the experience with a discretionary tip and we prefer to be in control of the amount of the tip. By not leaving it as a discretionary bonus you put the customer in an awkward position. This happens many times in the better restaurants in the UK. We find many of the comparable places include a service charge on the bill. Regardless that there is a service charge, the customer feels obligated to tip on top of the service charge. So instead of leaving the restaurant on a high from a good meal and a good experience, one feels a sense of disquiet. Did I leave enough of a supplemental tip, did I leave too much or too little. These are the feelings I and others I speak to have with the UK system. With a hundred plus trips to the UK under our belts, we are comfortable saying that the level of service in the USA is higher at comparable restaurants to the ones in the UK. This does not provide comfort that service levels will be maintained under the new no tipping scheme at USC.",2015-12-15,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_62295"

We had a somewhat curious visit to the Breslin for Sunday lunch. Initially the service was decent with the waiter being attentive and taking our order but afterwards we never saw anyone and trying to get our coffee topped up was just ridiculous. The actual food itself was superb tasty and delicious, couldn't be faulted really. It did take a little while to arrive but the place was busy so understandable. A waitress came to top up our coffee's while we waited but ran out half way through pouring the first cup. Around 15 minutes later we managed to attract her attention and she said that they had run out of coffee but was assured she would be back soon. This clearly wasn't true as everyone that came in was ordering and receiving fresh cups of coffee. We therefore had to eat our food with no drinks. The attitude of the servers in general left a bad taste in the mouth and spoilt what should have been an enjoyable brunch. In the end we gave up on the coffee, especially as by now even asking for and paying the bill was taking nearly half an hour. Take my advice don't go here.

We were seated in a very romantic booth for two that my wife thought I must have arranged specially (actually, I had simply made the reservation on Open Table about 10 days in advance). Our server was a young, friendly woman who was well-trained and knowledgeable about wine. She gladly made some menu recommendations. We shared a bottle of reasonably-priced Gruener Veltliner, which was perfect for a late spring lunch. The three-item amuse bouche was wonderful, especially the spicy cucumber soup topped with beet foam. For starters, I had the sea scallops with caramelized cauliflower and my wife had the crispy crab. Both were very good to excellent. As mains, we both had the waitress-recommended crusted Black Sea Bass over sweet and sour jus. This dish was incredible - one of the most exquisite things I've ever eaten. We went with another waiter recommended item for a shared dessert, which actually came off the starters menu: foie gras brulee with roasted strawberries - our kind of dessert. Of course, petit fours were served as well, so there was some sugar to finish things off with our espresso. With tip, a bottle of wine, and several courses of food, our bill was $245, a great value for what we received.

We opted for the Chef Tasting Menu and we were very impressed with the entire experience. Saying the food was tasty is an understatement! Each course was a delight for the senses mixing textures, aromas, flavours and presentation to the highest level! It was a true culinary experience. The size of the portions ensured that we had enough for each course to fully savour the creations but not too much that we could not indulge in the 6 courses! The cocktail menu was enticing and we both thoroughly enjoyed our cocktails! I strongly suggest that you have one as you read though the menu. The service was professional, competent and friendly without feeling like you were going to be everyone's best friend afterwards! The 2 servers coming out with both our courses together was great! The waiter's explanation of what each dish was created from was wonderful - it allowed us to begin anticipating what we were about to eat. Yes, it is expensive but then you get what you pay for and this was worth every penny that we paid! Mas is on my favorite restaurant list for sure!",2014-04-08,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_91381"

I ordered an alcoholic drink off the menu and we ordered 2 appetizers (wings and nachos) to share. After waiting about 20 minutes or so and the drinks did not show up my boyfriend got up to look for our waiter and went over by the bar to ask what was going on with our drinks. As he was gone, our appetizers showed up and I asked where my drink was and the waiter told me that he wasn't sure. He left to find out and came back to tell me the didn't have the ingredients to mix my drink. (?) He did not even appologize just sort of looked at me. So I said a water would be fine. The wings were TERRIBLE. My guess is that they were cooked an hour before I had even gotten them and then they were thrown in some sauce prior to being given to me. They were hard as a rock (no pun intended) and they were cold. The nachos were okay, they were a bit mushy as if they had been sitting under a hot light for a while. When the server came back around we told him the wings were really bad and that we did not intend to pay for them as we didn't eat them. Again, he did not appologize just gave us a glare and grabbed the wings and walked away. Seeing how this was our first day it really set a mood for us for the remainder of the day. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone I know. Your welcome for the head's up :)",2012-12-04,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_57431"

So this year we again found ourselves at the bar, cocktails in hand chatting to the friendly staff and tucking into one of the tastiest porterhouses we can remember.

Order several dishes and share them with everyone in your party. They take your order and bring the food out as each dish is ready. This keeps the food fresh and hot.

"29052","Pylos",5,"review_217893790","Greek Experience Uncommonly Good","We didn't have reservations and the place was packed, but they offered us seats at a community table with just a 15 minute wait. SO GLAD that we had the chance to sit there-- it's not like the normal NYC table with 10 strangers. THIS was a marble topped huge cooking space with the staff on one side and diners on the other, tons of space and extremely prompt service. Wines chilled in buckets on the other side and drinks appeared two minutes after ordering them. Water glasses never ran dry. We sampled several appetizers/small plates and favorites include saganaki tou merakli (three cheeses baked in a pot) and pitakia kaisarias which were delicate pockets of phyllo filled with some kind of spiced beef, fresh tomatoes and kasseri cheese. Share the Greek salad, which three of us split-- tasty big chunks of marinated tomato, cucumbers, feta and red onion slivers with olives. Same thing with the beet salad-- it is a LOT of beets! And you MUST try the Poikilia- which comes with three dipping sauces for the warm pita bread. The lemony fish roe dip was surprising light and tasty (and I'm not a fish roe fan). My favorite entree was the moussaka-- this Greek comfort food was so flavorful with its aromatic ground meat sauce. The bechamel puffed up beautifully and the sauteed eggplant and zucchini was perfectly spiced. My husband had the krasata paidakia-- braised short ribs slow cooked in red wine and a potato puree. My daughter enjoyed the avgolemono me sampania-- the classic egg-lemon soup made with chicken stock and orzo. Quite tasty. I'm positive that our various plates would not have fit on a traditional table, so we were all glad to be at the 'communal table'-- if you have a chance to sit there, don't hesitate! The seats at the communal table are wide, solid, comfortable low stools (no backaches for anyone).  I highly recommend this place-- the decor is interesting, too-- the ceiling is made up of orange clay pots! The staff were extremely helpful in giving opinions and explaining terms. All in all, one of the best meals we've had. By the way, PYLOS is pronounced Pee-'los and comes from the root word that means clay (hence the clay pots on the ceiling).",2014-07-27,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_6662"

Although it was a bit of a trek at the end of a long day we wanted pizza and decided to go for it.  Sacco is a small hole in the wall local restaurant that you may just walk past and not notice. They only make pizza and you can order a slice or a whole pizza. Most people were locals and took theirs to go. There are a few tables in the back, self serve drink coolers and take note that there are no public restrooms. All that aside the pizza was fantastic...even my husband who dislikes pizza was impressed. The pizza was tasty and filling. The staff friendly and you could watch them make the pizza if it wasn't so busy. Definitely a restaurant that we will return to. The large pizza with 4 drinks was around $30.

"127363","Gotham_Bar_Grill",5,"review_301756253","Thank you Alfred","i must have contributed over $2M in sales at the Gotham since I moved next door in 1985. For the past two years, I have been living in the center of Firenze, with a fiancé who has cooked for the great Florentine Nobility, those very ones who are selling thousands of bottles of their Tuscan wines world wide. No one has ever complained about Tuscan cooking. I live 150 yards from the Central Market of San Lorenzo. I eat at many restaurants here and in the hills of Tuscany. However, nothing has given me more culinary delight than Alfred and chefs at the Gotham Bar & Grill. As far as I am concerned, Alfred has spear headed an American cuisine, international, in the least, that together with Alice Waters on the West Coast, which is as good, if not better, than all kitchens. Beginning with his representation of the Manhattan skyline in his presentations/plating, Alfred has created dishes that to this day are singularly delicious: Beet Salad; foie gras terrine; tuna tartar which is the best ever. I have had Australian friends who only wanted to eat lamb at the Gotham feeling embarrassed that this was much tastier than Australian Lamb which is the hallmark. His french fired onion rings and his fries are addicting, worthy of 3 stars Michelin. His duck, pork chop, lobster and the original seared tuna with cracked pepper and chicken w shoestring fries, are as viid in my palate today as they were when i consumed them. His burger; his soft shell crabs; his soups are originals that must be preserved for posterity. Alfred created bar seating par excellence. Joel Rubuchon then copied him at his Atelier in Paris. every restaurant needs bar seating.  i send everyone who appreciates food to eat there. I have had over 2,000 meals there. the staff is family and the busboys even more so. everyone should have the pleasure of being blessed with such a neighbor and the means to enjoy every morsel and every drop. god bless alfred and staff.",2015-08-21,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_571"

He was so busy cooking our food that we didn't see him but I would rather he concentrate on the food and not on hobnobbing with guests. We arrived without a reservation at 6:15pm and were told it would probably be a 90-minute wait for a table. The restaurant was large, with very high ceilings. It was warm and had a nice bar area (once you got past the rather formidable lady employees who man the front desk. They took our coats away but then gave them back later. The decor of the restaurant is like a gentleman's club or a library, but a library where they don't mind if you eat your lunch and talk to your friend. Having got past the portal guardians, we went to the bar, but when I tried to sit down a barman politely shouted at me because I wasn't allowed there, and he would rather two elvish maidens with long tresses of golden hair sat down. When they moved on, he said now we could sit there. We both have dark hair, so we feel this is probably fair. We had a cocktail each, made very well and put in interesting containers made from glass. After having waited for about 40 minutes, we were taken to table. The 90-minute thing was presumably a cunning test!  Our waiter was young, strange, and rather quiet - he would sneak up on you and put some bread near your hand without saying anything. When we sat down, he came and said, ""Happy Saturday"" to us. We felt really special. Then we heard him saying it to other people who were having dinner at other tables. We felt a little sad then and I had a quick cry. What did we order? Well, we had a bottle of Riesling, which was nice if a little winey. Steak tartare, with a tiny egg from maybe a wren on top of it, and some toast (one piece was a little burned). This dish was very tasty, but it would have been nice to have some condiments on the table so that seasoning could have been adjusted to taste. Then we shared agnolotti with pumpkin, sage, amaretto. It was very nice and tasty, the pasta cooked al dente. Portion size was probably about right. Then we ate a piglet with potatoes, and cod with some bits and pieces. To be honest, we were a little drunk by this point and talking about very interesting things. We had broccoli on the side, and this was nice but a little too bitter for my liking. Pudding was a very nice lemon tart with a limoncello granita and an ice-cream of some sort, and a chocolate torte with also an ice-cream of a different sort. They were both very good and tasty, but quite rich.  We were very full, but not too full to watch three episodes of Top Chef when we got home and comment on which food we would have liked to eat while Padma Lakshmi was saying something or other. She talks a lot of nonsense. While we were at Robert Deniro's restaurant we talked a lot about Top Chef. I think he may have heard us.",2014-02-16,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_172755"

It was. Wine is expensive, we pushed the boat out and paid the $50 dollars for the cheapest on the menu. Food was very good and what you'd expect to pay.

We sat down for dinner, the music was as loud as if you were having dinner at the disco. We could talk or hear each other across a table of 70x70 cm.  We started with a Sauvignon Blanc, and the waiter instead of bringing glasses and the bottle of the wine we ordered, he brought the wine already poured in. So you wouldn't really know which wine that was. The food fell really short we had about 4 dishes. We didn't touch the BBQ fries, a side of the starter. It was extremely over seasoned and salty. For main dish had a burger that was supposed to be medium well but it came medium rare. For the side we could have chosen of spinach, fries and a couple other things but I don't recall. The waiter didn't even ask us which side we wanted just gave us more BBQ Fries that we already had on the table almost untouched.  We also ordered the kale salad - another disappointment it had too much apple and had sugar covered pecans and kale leaves plus some red frizzy leaves. The salad was weirdly sweet.

The entrance leads to counter service and a few dining tables with an adjacent dining room filled with folks who know good food. Some reviews note small portions but I found the Nova with eggs and onions to be plenty to eat along with the bagel and cream cheese. The quality of the salmon is excellent and the bagels are very good (although I think Murray's has the best bagels in NYC). The restaurant is closed on Mondays and it's better to go after 2:00 or 3:00 if you want to avoid a wait..",2007-11-07,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_11791"

I have been visiting NYC my whole life and had never heard of restaurant row. Always trying to avoid touristy spots especially before or after a Broadway show, we were thrilled to find this adorable street with an array of cozy, charming restaurants. We chose Lattanzi. It was a Tuesday night at 6:30, and we did not have a reservation but I believe you can make them. You take a few steps down from the street and this cozy old fashioned Italian restaurant was candle lit, quiet, relaxing and friendly. We ordered 1/2 orders of pasta which was so nice since I never finish and apps and wine. We were not rushed and the staff could not have been nicer. Friendly, reasonable and a very relaxing meal.

I ordered a Caesar salad, and quite possibly the best mushroom pizza I've ever had. I also ordered a decadent carrot cake with whipped cream, and ate that with part of my friend's ricotta cheesecake. Those two desserts were two of the best ones I've ever eaten; they were sweet, but not cloying, and incredibly moist. I particularly loved the cheesecake. My server was Nook, who was very nice, courteous and quite diligent with her service.

The restaurant which entirely walled in glass overlooking the plaza on one end and the street on the other. The decor is very contemporary -- elegant and spare. The kitchen is also entirely walled in glass and once can see the preparation which is something that I have always liked. The service is superb -- friendly, always availbable, but not fawning. The menu is just two pages long -- four or five antipasti, some pasta dishes (all handmade), four or five fish dishes, four or five meat dishes, and three or four vegetable offerings. A limited selection is often the sign of extra high quality, and we were not disappointed. My companion had octopus with muscles in a divine sauce for the first course. I had escarole with white anchovies, and a parmesana reggiano sauce. For the main course, we both had a halibut dish which was done to perfection, and for desert a savory, fruity custard with spicy pumpkin bread and other gourmet treats. The expresso came with little dolci that were delicious. The wine selection was outstanding. I had the best verdicchio that I had drunk in years.

Two poached eggs were served on focaccia bread with a salad (the home made dressing is incredible!!) and short rib hash! Wow!! My husband had the same.

"379272","District_Tap_House",5,"review_373725249","nothing but praise","I came here back in February during NYC Beer Week (also my 1st trip to NY). My husband and I had been walking around on an adventure all day and we were starving. As luck would have it, we couldn't locate the restaurant we were mapping and it started drizzling when we spotted District Tap House. It was late afternoon and not packed at all. I imagine we came in between their rush hours of lunch and dinner because it was filling up fast by the time we left. They actually sat us in a nice booth in the far back, instead of the cluttered tables up front. The trip downstairs to the restroom was also a fun little adventure. But on to the good stuff! First, I would like to take the time to acknowledge the staff's professional presence. I had a new girl training, but that did not effect her promptness and knowledge. The only mistake she made was that she let us order the Szechaun Pepper hot wings without a warning LOL! Apparently these are only available during Beer Week so we figured why the hell not?? Beer and wings is never a bad choice. These wings, however, were about 9 out of 10 HOT HOT HOT! We weren't about to sissy out so we asked for some blue cheese (apparently not stocked in this restaurant) but they did go out of their way to get us some ranch instead to cool it down. The bartender at the main bar came over and introduced himself and apologized for the wings (normally they give an honest warning but the new girl was not aware since it is only a Beer Week menu item). Like i said, no biggie, but the attention to us was appreciated. We also ordered the goat cheese croquettes and duck fat fries. The croquettes were delicious and fried perfectly. We are from Miami so it takes a lot to give a croquette a stamp of approval. The accompanying pepper honey sauce only made them more delectable. Duck fat fries - I mean what is there to say?? DUCK.FAT.FRIES = party in your mouth!  Finally, the beer selection is what will bring me back. They have an extensive list of beers to choose from, a lot being locally sourced, which I love even more. The aforementioned bartender did an amazing job of suggesting our next beers to try after our 1st round order. This was probably my favorite dining experience while in New York. It was upscale but not overpriced or pretentious. The food hooked us in and the staff sealed the deal. Cannot wait to come back next year and start a tradition with the hubby!

We arrived around 6:15 and put our name on the wait list, which was about an hour and a half long. They took our cell phone number and then we walked around the village window shopping and checked out the Highline. By the time they called us for our table we had all worked up a great appetite.  We had a small table for four in the back on the second floor near the bar. It was definitely cozy but still comfortable.  For appetizers we split the tongue (loved it), crispy fried pigs ear (delicious!), and the prosciutto fritters (meh, not so great and a little gamey...) A friend ordered the pumpkin and farro soup, which was very good, too.  For entrees, my boyfriend and I had both had the burger. It was amazing. It was cooked to a perfect medium for me. The Roquefort cheese was funky, stinky, and wonderful! It was super pungent and flavorful and added a complexity to the burger that I wasn't expecting. I definitely recommend the burger, but if a mild blue cheese offends you, there is no way you'll be able to stand this one.

So if you read this, here's an unbiased word-of-mouth opinion. I reserved for 10pm to fuel my family after we'd been to the (excellent) Wicked show at the Gershwin, just up Broadway. The show emptied out at 945pm and by 10pm I had a dirty martini in one hand and a wine list in the other with the meal already ordered. I explained my youngest, 10, was flagging a little but determined to have an Italian post-theatre dinner like her more grown up brother (17) and sister (14). Our waiter and a cooperative kitchen made sure the kids ate well and quickly. I had a perfect straciatella special to make sure we kept pace and then a very good tenderloin special -one from a range of good specials. My wife had a very good linguine nero - and she knows her linguine! An impressive wine list : we had a great Brunello which for Europeans was not hugely expensive at $105. There was a nice post-theatre buzz and volume levels were high -though given my own girls were debriefing me on their reviews of the earlier performance I could hardly complain. On this performance, I would say trecolori (whose website suggested a somewhat more Mom and Pop setup) are more ristorante than trattoria but , regardless of classification, an excellent pre and post theatre choice. Enjoy! (and the dessert cart is very good - i'm more espresso doppio but my wife and I shared the lovely ricotta cheesecake while my son ( a tiramisu afficionado) pronounced his as being among his best ever and the girls were equally happy).",2008-07-30,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_50041"

I have been to many restaurants and cocktail bars in NY, and have never been charged extra for a drink on the rocks. When I told the manager that it seemed weird to me to be charged extra for ice, she said ""I guess it's not weird to me because I work here."" As a courtesy, they took the $6 off the bill.

Just off the theatre district in New York city you can find ""Churrascaria Plataforma"" and come prepared because this place is TERRIFIC! - it starts with a terrific self serve salad bar with all the regular selections with one big difference, they are meticulously prepared and delicious. Once you get to your table and flip your red-green coaster to green, you are headed for a roller coaster ride of meat, meat and more meat. The lamb the night I visited was astonishing and the ribeye steak was absolutely perfect. The safe bet in any churascaria is to take a little, and take a lot of varieties. This is a truly rare treat where you can sample so many different cuts of Pork, Beef, Lamb and Chicken cooked in the tradition Brazilian method of a vertical rotisserie, guaranteeing no burning and no greasiness.  Truly Olympian preparation is required, you need to bring a very healthy appetite but I promise you if you are adequately prepared you will be charmed by the terrific service and spectacular flavor and variety you will find at this very traditional Brazilian eatery.",2015-07-26,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_8945"

"460482","Cosme",4,"review_259395346","Great new restaurant in Flatiron","We, a party of 4, had reservation at 6:30 pm on Friday in this new hot spot. When we arrived we got seated right away. At 6:30 pm, the restaurant was already crowded. In the front, there is a large bar with counter seating and then some communal tables for walk-ins I presume. When we were leaving, that place was jam packed and seemed hectic for quiet meal. However, the seating area in the back with reservation is very pleasant with a lot of space between tables. The décor is minimal with wooden tables and dark lighting but which directly focuses on the table and food. The restaurant is owned by famous Mexican Chef Enrique Olvera who has one of the top 50 restaurants in Mexico City. The menu is relatively small but well designed. The food is to be shared as tapas style and at the bottom of the menu the items are supposed to be larger portion. We ordered and shared:  Scallop aguachile, poached jicama, fresh wasabi-cucumber-lime Arctic Char tostada (This is not on the website menu but it was on the restaurant menu) Cobia al pastor, pineapple purée, cilantro Mushroom and squash barbacoa, chilpachole, hoja santa Ayocote bean salad, radish, charred cucumber vinaigrette Crispy octopus, hazelnut mole, pickled potatoes, watercress Duck carnitas, onions, radishes, salsa verde (to share) The service is very good and the food is fantastic with really new flavorful sensations. People might complain that the portions are small but that seems to be the standard these days. For example, you get only one piece of octopus for $28.00. But no matter, they are tasty and excellently seasoned. We also had margarita and beer which is priced very reasonably at $7.00. One thing, I must say that when my wife asked for iced tea, they said they don't carry iced tea but they will check. And later on the server came with a glass of iced tea. I think that was a really good service.  If you can snare a reservation, this restaurant is worth a try.",2015-03-14,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_4120"

We had two sides of bacon for the table, thick, greasy peppery, with a subtle smoky flavor which was flat-out delicious – damm the statins! Full cholesterol ahead! Note that in my last review the sausage was simply bland and tasteless, so give it a miss.  In my last review I said “The service was attentive, cheerful and professional but a bit slow.” It wasn’t slow this time but there was a bobble. One of our party was delivered the wrong dish and it took about ten minutes for the right dish to be delivered. The waiter told us the four coffees we all had after the meal were on him as his way of apology.  The bill for all of this, with no alcohol, was 112 bucks which is quite reasonable for the superb food and the Manhattan location.

"460591","Cosme",3,"review_278561540","Poor experience. Service was bad. Food is ok. Expensive","Even though I had a bad service experience, I try to do my reviews as fair as possible.  Service: For a restaurant with so much hype and for the price, service has to be good. Excellent would be the best option, but lets say that good should be the standard. Waiting 15-20 minutes for the waiter to bring the menu and take the drink order is not what is expected. One curious thing is that the restaurant has plenty of staff, but only the ""waiter"" can take orders. Main issue with service was ordering and bring the drinks. After, service was ok.  Food: Nothing related to the hype. The menu is limited (not that many choices) and after ordering probably 10-12 different plates the only two that I would recommend are The duck carnitas (really good) and the asparagus. The Octopus and the cobia al pastor were ok. The rest of the plates were just average. The Chicharron is not worth it at all. Plates are small and expensive.

Looking for that one special place where we could sit down and enjoy being in New York City without too much noise and utter craziness that you find at a lot of brunch places.  There definitely is a process that you must go through to get into the restaurant. So, we advise that you arrive early to make sure you get your name on the list else you run the risk of having to wait a cool 30 minutes or more; If you arrive early, just make sure you check in with the wait staff to get your name on the list; They've developed a pretty efficient system which helps them to accomodate their patrons due to the small facility. Overall the staff was excellent and very attentive; Alecia was our waitress and she did a good job keeping our con leche and juice glasses filled;  My wife and I really enjoy restaurants where everything is fresh; On this trip we ordered somje fresh fruit, fish tacos, french onion soup and their Clinton St. Omlette; Mmm Mmm.. good food (a little bland, we prefer food with some kick) for a good price; We'll definitely go back!!",2008-10-12,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_83462"

"136785","Scarpetta",3,"review_517045831","Once was Enough","The fact that Scott Bryant is a judge on the ridiculous show “Chopped,” may have led me to go to his restaurant during Restaurant week to see what he really could do, so my wife and I went during Restaurant week. My expectation was that the smarter restaurants would choose some showcase items in the hopes of luring back people who used restaurant week as an opportunity to explore restaurants that they would otherwise not have a chance to try. Scarpetta’s was hopping when we arrived for dinner. It was very noisy and remained so, necessitating the need to almost shout to the waiter to be heard. Our waiter was both pleasant and attentive and groomed to look like Scott Bryant: two day growth of beard and all. Our seat was near the window, an excellent location for people watching without the noise from the street, although it might have been slightly quieter outside. I would suggest asking for seating in this location. There aren’t many. Sadly, the food reminded me of the line “raising mediocrity to new heights.” It certainly was OK, but hardly unforgettable. I had to go back to the menu on line to remember what we had. My wife had a salad followed by Spaghetti. I had the Creamy Polenta with truffled mushrooms (Honestly, I couldn’t detect any obvious truffle flavor. Perhaps it was seasoned with truffle oil?) and Zucchini Mezzaluna. We ended with Mascarpone cheesecake.  Everything was OK, but there was nothing there that would draw us back. My wife’s entrée, which was listed somewhat grandiosely as Spaghetti with Tomato and Basil was really just spaghetti in an everyday marinara sauce; I have done this as well (or better) many times at home. The Zucchini Mezzaluna were tasty little half-moon shaped ravioli, and while being perhaps the best item in the meal because of their sauce and somewhat unique filling, were not outstanding enough to merit a return trip, and the cheesecake was…well…cheesecake.  I would add that the wine prices were lower that those we had encountered at other restaurants, and that the pour seemed more generous. The food portions were fine; we were filled but not stuffed. Sadly, we left feeling that there were probably better Italian restaurants in New York City, but cheered up by the prospects of exploring them. For us, Scarpetta’s was a one-time venture.  With Restaurant Week prices in effect, the cost of the meal with a simple pasta and three glasses of wine was in the $150-160 range including tax and tip. As always, my wife gets the credit for the reviews, but they are written by her husband who has been cooking (and eating) Italian food himself for way too long to be easily impressed.",2017-08-24,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_30717"

We sat by the window and enjoyed looking onto the street at night, had good food, and nice service. We had one dish we all especially loved, some sort of goat cheese quesadilla appetizer. When we returned the second time, we couldn't find it on the menu. We guessed at something that sounded to be it but were disappointed when it wasn't. The food wasn't as good as we remembered, nor was the ambiance. Tonight, we returned for the third time and were seated in the farther back, bigger room of the restaurant. The environment—bright lighting and yellow-painted walls—felt cheap. We felt like we were eating in a walk-in buffet. For a meal of this price, it shouldn't have looked the way that it did. The waiter took the drink order of one of the three members of our party. He then proceeded to forget the type of wine she ordered, come back, and ask, again walking away without taking anybody else's orders. We had to ask another waiter for the other drinks. Again, we tried to find the previously mentioned goat cheese starter from our first visit. We, again, made our best guess and were wrong. Maybe they took it off the menu; maybe we just weren't looking hard enough. The food was poor-to-mediocre. Nothing was terrible, but it, again, felt like we were eating at a cheap buffet. Nothing was good enough to deserve the title of good. The Olive Garden serves better food, for a much lower price.

Wen you enter Urbanspace you will be surprised with the industrial open space atmosphere. Located inside is over a dozen different eating establishments. Something for everyone. This morning we grabbed a delicious breakfast sandwich (2 eggs, cheese and bacon on a Kaiser roll). This was super yummy and so affordable. I did take notice of the extended line at the coffee bar even though there was a Starbucks right next door. From the size of the line this must be the go to coffee spot. While eating breakfast I noticed a place that opens later that served lobster. Knew I wanted to return for that.  Later that day my fiancé and I walked to Central Park. We thought while we were in that area we could grab a bite. Nothing looked as delicious as the lobster spot I saw earlier in the day. Therefore we walked from Central Park all the way back to 45th & Vanderbilt. Once getting to Red Hook Lobster Pound I ordered the combo or lobster grilled cheese (with bacon & tomato) with a bowl of clam chowder. My Fiancé ordered lobster Mac & Cheese. Both of our meals were AMAZING!!!!! Worth every step of the walk from CP to Urbanspace. The portions are not huge but more the perfect size and extremely affordable. The staff at the Red Hook were super friendly and took the time to have a conversation with us.

If you have a big stroller, then it won't fit in their hiding place. They do have high chairs and were willing to take chairs away and take off (dirty) table cloths.

I asked for some sauce and got a little bowel which was not nearly enough for all those fries. So i asked for another one and another one and another one! bit really great for a so called gastro-pub! it got a bit strained after that and the service was not impressed with our behavior. We also paid 14 dollars for a glass of mulled wine as it was a cold day...ouch!!! I dont mind spending money on quality but this place is definitely not it. Way over hyped and the service is poor.

Italian food is the type of food I first think of when I think NYC, thats the way of it. Isn't it? Even if not, it's what we wanted to try the most whilst in NYC.  We were not wanting to do the fine dining experience, that can be had. We love our food, but find quite often the reputation of a restaurant being fine dining sets the bar high and we often come away disappointed. BECCO was perfect. We took up their lunch deal of Antipasto or caeser salad starter and 3 types of pasta of the day, main course (unlimited serves). Not just pasta and sauce, but ravioli, shrimps, feta etc in the ingredients. They give you a basket of breads and a dip and olives, when you are seated. We added a bottle of Italian wine ($25)and I had their cantaloupe granita for dessert($10). Paid $125 including the tip. for three people and the dessert was enough to share (not that I really wanted them to share my dessert!). It was divine, loved the dehydrated cantaloupe on the top, loved the granita.  Highly, highly recommend.

If you have to wait to get a table it won't be a long wait. Don't go somewhere else.  The menu is typical diner fare (with a couple of Greek favourites thrown in). We tried a few dishes and all were excellent. On two occasions we sat in the front part of the diner. There is a back room which we were seated in on the other two occasions.

The drink prices were pretty outrageous, btw. Our waiter, Kevin, came over promptly and was absolutely terrific from that point on. As mentioned by other reviewers, the bread, both rolls and sourdough(?) with two kinds of butter, were terrific. We ordered the foie gras two-ways appetizer to share and basically fought over every morsel. Great! My wife had the seared duck breast that she loved and I had the best pork chop ever. It was very thick but very juicy accompanied with not very tender green onions that had been seared, probably too much. The mustard that was on the chop was a bit too intense for my palate.

Between the four of us we had escargot, crab cakes and a fresh crab cocktail for starters and then followed up with bone in filet and filet medallions. Sides of cauliflower with Brie, asparagus with almonds and lobster Mac and cheese complimented the mains very well. Chocolate soufflé cake was ordered for dessert with vanilla ice cream. A few points on this; firstly if you're expecting a warm, light soufflé then you'll be sorely disappointed. It's the first time I've ever been served a soufflé outside of a pot. Also, warmth was barely there and it's more like a dense lava cake (without the lava). The vanilla ice cream and fresh raspberries were beautiful though and complimented it nicely.

The wine list, too, although pricey, does have excellent values in the $80.00-$100.00 range. The grilled octopus is fantastic! The waiters are friendly and helpful. Enjoy the show!

That was on her, not the restaurant. The waiters were on top of everything without being intrusive and asking you every five minutes if you needed something.

You cannot make a reservation unless it's for a party of 15 or more. So, you can plan on a crowded, loud wait--if that's not your kind of thing, make a reservation elsewhere. We were given a number when we came in and made our way through the crowd to the bar for red sangria's, which were very good ($10 apiece). We waited a long time, standing in our little space, probably about an hour. The place is pretty big but very popular and right in Times Square. There is a big downstairs and a mezzanine upstairs. It used to be a church, I believe. The pizzas are reasonably priced at around $15 for a large. We had bruschetta as an appetizer which consisted of toasted bread and a bowl of diced tomatoes. It was okay. Our pizza was very good with a thin, crispy crust from a wood-fired oven, which I think is the best way to cook a pizza. I have to say though that I did not enjoy the wait. There were way too many people in a small area with standing room only, except for a dozen or so seats at the bar. I would try it again but maybe for lunch hoping it would be less crowded. If you don't like very loud and crowded places, not for you.

We were surprised when we arrived to find a MOST casually dressed clientele with very few jackets--or jackets that were more in line with those worn for a sporting event in an atmosphere I would describe as 'shabby chic"".  There is an attached ABC KITCHEN store selling housewares and some furnishings.  The menu covered dishes from fish, pizzas, small plates and appetizers, house made pastas, meats. I opted for house made ricotta which was fresh, creamy, and tasty. It was served with crusty bread and rhubarb jam ($15). As an entree, I ordered the small plate of Campanelle pasta with spring peas, pistachio and basil pesto ($18). The portion was small, a little less than 8 ounces by by estimation, but tasty.

The portions of everything were generous and the price extremely reasonable for the obvious freshness and quality. While I waited I appreciated a much-needed small coffee.

He not only served food and drink with absolute professionalism but filled me in on the rather storied history of the bar which has been there since the 1800's. The food?, it was fantastic. I had the burger which has been spoken about in previous reviews. It was likely the best burger I have had anywhere. In addition, the deserts are all home made (I had the apple cobbler - outstanding). In fact, I came back later the same night for another burger. The menu has a huge selection of steaks, pork chops, and other steakhouse favorites, as well as great side dishes. For those who enjoy it, there is a raw bar adjacent to the bar area and from what I saw, everyone who ordered from it was very very happy. The atmosphere is more of a neighborhood bar that happily accepts non-loclas into their gem of a spot.

The portions were large and luckily we all ordered different sides and 6 shared but quite a bit left over. The steak was amazing and quite possibly the best I’ve eaten and for $55 it should be good. A couple of niggles - the temperature kept going from hot to really cold and when the air conditioning was on, our food went cold really quickly and I am a slow eater so cold dinner isn’t ideal. Also a forgotten potato was rectified but 2/3rds way through the meal. I found the staff pleasant but didn’t expect to remind them to top up my drink and to clear the unused glasses cluttering up the table.

"383140","Cask_Bar_Kitchen",4,"review_225156822","Excellent Service. Food is Average. Great Drink List.","Service: Came to this bar on a Friday evening (around 6pm) with two of my girlfriends. We had no reservation. I arrived first and was expecting one friend so I was seated at a table for two; but unexpectedly another guest arrived so we needed to move to a larger table. The hostess was very pleasant and accommodating. She gave me no grief about having no reservation or switching tables. The servers were very casual and friendly. Not pushy and giving plenty of space and time to decide on selection of drinks and food. Shortly after we sat down, water and bread with olives was on the table and we were cheerfully asked about our drink choices.  Drinks/Food: The drink menu (wine, beer, cocktails – and a bar in general) is vast and appealing but I went with my usual glass of Malbec ($10). My friend tried some sparkling cocktail (range is $10-12) and was quite happy with it. The food menu includes small and large plates, salads, burgers and flat breads. We decided to go with a salad to share and a big plate. For salad we chose a lovely and fresh roasted pear salad with gorgonzola and hazel nuts ($10). The plate is a medium size so you can surely share – I recommend it. For a large plate, we chose seafood paella (but had chorizo) ($24). The plate is also medium size and two people can certainly enjoy it. It is difficult to come across a “real” paella. This one was all right but I will not rave about it. The mussels were a bit small and I thought the rice was “too” flavorful – killed taste of seafood a bit. We also tried truffle mac and cheese ($13), which came in a small-med sized skillet and was creamy and delicious. Atmo/Decor: A lovely and cozy place. When you walk in, there is a bar – most people were gathered there; and when you pass the bar, you reach the hostess and the main dining area. The dimply lit space has brick walls, wooden tables, lots of candles and charming décor on the walls. Along the wall, there are tables for two, in the middle there is a long wooden table, and there is a separate (but open) elevated area with a table that can fit a few people. It might be cool for a hang-out. Overall, I would recommend this charming place for a casual evening and a nice drink with an appetizer.",2014-08-28,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_63321"

Over our many visits, we have eaten at many pizza places while in the city and looked for something new to try. Based on reviews and happening to be in the area at lunch time, we figured we would give John’s a try. The place is very small and unassuming. In fact if you have been to Gino’s in Chicago, it is A LOT like that – an small older pizza place that has not been updated in quite a bit, but who cares because you are there for the pizza, not the ambiance! We got there around 11 so it was not very crowded. But I will say by the time we left around noon – the place was packed! My advice would be to get there early before the lunch crowd comes in – otherwise you will be waiting.  I must admit I am from St. Louis and love cracker thin crust pizza with provel cheese, so I may be a bit biased and not the best judge… but I will say the pizza was good for NY style - but not great. I thought the toppings were kind of sparse, the cheese was fairly bland and not much of it, but the sauce had a good kick to it! The sauce is what saved the pizza for me – otherwise I would have thought it was below average.  So while the pizza in my mind was nothing amazing (I understand I seem to be in the minority based on the reviews I have read), I did like the people running the place. They were very friendly and provided good service – I would recommend the place on that alone for anyone thinking about trying this place – and you might end up loving the pizza like most people on this site apparently do.

We were asked if we'd like to look at the wine list & ordered a bottle. The only place to sit & wait was on chairs outside. We sat there for about 5 minutes & then were brought two mugs that contained our choice of wine & they explained that the bottle was being kept cool behind the bar. This was unusual, but kinda quirky & added to our dining experience. It was a lovely evening watching the city go by & we were soon asking for a top up & forgetting how long we were waiting. We were offered a seat at the bar area to eat and after reading the reviews on here we'd already decided to share a meatball slider starter & both wanted the chicken main dish. The waitress told us that the starter is usually 3 balls, but as we were sharing she'd ask the kitchen for 4. They were delicious & like mini burger balls covered in gravy. The chicken was perfectly cooked & the skin well crisped & tasty. We also had the corn side dish & loved it. We were so full that we couldn't manage dessert, so we settled our bill. The waitress topped up our glasses with more wine, we'd already finished the bottles that we'd paid for, but she said 'have an extra drink on me' The service & atmosphere is what made our experience so special",2014-08-19,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_22157"

The day we arrived in NYC, they called again only to say that they closed at the time of our reservation and were we still planning on coming in. Huh?

To top off this disaster of a meal, the coffee looked and tasted like dishwater. Think tourist trap.",2016-03-14,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_29414"
"446071","Blue_Note",5,"review_543445834","Amazing Place","We are from Alaska. We have nothing like this at home. We went to the Blue Note with a cousin who has been here before. The intimate entertainment setting was fantastic. You are really jammed in though. GO EARLY!!! No reserved seating. I am not a real jazz lover, but the music this night was great, provided by the Stanley Clarke Band, featuring Lenny White. Beka Gochiashvili & Salar Nadar. I have never heard the stand up base played like a lead guitar as Stanley Clarke did that evening. The food and drinks were good, but secondary to the music. In fact it was so dark during the performance that it was hard to tell what you were eating, but I knew what I ordered (rockfish) and it was good. It was a pricey evening ($400) for three of us with cover, food and drinks, but hey, it is the ""Big Apple"" and it was an unforgettable evening.",2017-11-26,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_66749"

We visited first for breakfast which was first class even though there was a wait for a table which proves just how popular this place is! Second visit for dinner with a great choice of menu can highly recommend the Filet Mignon which was cooked to perfection. On both occasions the service was first class with friendly staff. Facilities such as rest room were clean Etc. Highly recommend",2019-04-13,"New_York_City_New_York","UID_18016"
